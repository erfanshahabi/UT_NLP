User: how can i make pizza?
Assistant: To make pizza at home, you can follow these basic steps derived from the information I found:

### Ingredients:
- **Dough**: 1½ cups warm water (105°F-115°F), 1 package active dry yeast, 3¾ cups bread flour, 2 tbsp olive oil, 2 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp sugar.
- **Sauce**: Tomato sauce or white sauce.
- **Toppings**: Cheese (mozzarella, fontina, etc.), vegetables (sautéed or raw), meats (pepperoni, sausage, etc.), and any other favorite toppings.

### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Dough**:
   - Dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes.
   - In a mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar. Then, add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.
   - Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until smooth. Place it in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.

2. **Preheat the Oven**: 
   - Heat your oven to 550°F (or the highest setting). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.

3. **Assemble the Pizza**:
   - Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
   - Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel (or an inverted baking sheet) sprinkled with cornmeal to prevent sticking.
   - Top the dough with sauce, followed by your choice of cheese and toppings.

4. **Bake the Pizza**:
   - Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.
   - Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.

5. **Serve**:
   - Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool slightly, slice, and enjoy!
