For as long as\\n]\\n     people have inhabited this planet, edibles have been imbued with all sorts\\n     of  attributes  beyond  satisfying  hunger  and  sustaining  life.  And  in  many\\n     cases,  popular  notions  about  the  powers  of  various  foods  and  beverages\\n     have been documented by modern scientific investigations that have dem-\\n 1   onstrated, for example, the soothing qualities of chicken soup for sufferers\\n     of the common cold, and the antibiotic properties of garlic.\\n             Then there are the newer discoveries not rooted in folklore, among\\n     them the protection against cancer afforded by vegetables and fruits rich in\\n [   the carotenoid pigments and the cancer-blockers found in members of the\\n     cabbage  family;  the  cholesterol-lowering  ability  of  apples,  barley,  beans,\\n     garlic, and oats; the heart-saving qualities of fish and alcohol (in moderate\\n     amounts), and the antidiabetic properties of foods rich in dietary fiber.\\n 8           But while thinking of food as preventive or cure, it is important not\\n     to lose sight of its basic values: to provide needed nutrients and a pleasur-\\n     able eating experience while satisfying hunger and thirst.\\n             In  The  New  Complete  Book  of  Food  Carol  Ann  Rinzler  has  put  it  all\\n     together, providing a handy, illuminating guide for all who shop, cook, and\\n /   eat. It is a “must have” for all those who want to get the very most out of\\n     the foods they eat, as well as avoid some inevitable dietary and culinary\\n     pitfalls. Ms. Rinzler tells you how to derive the maximum nutritive value\\n     from  the  foods  you  buy  and  ingest,  with  handy  tips  on  how  to  select,\\n w   store,  prepare,  and  in  some  cases  serve  foods  to  preserve  their  inherent\\n     worth and avoid their risks. For example, in preparing bean sprouts, you’ll\\n     be cautioned to eat them within a few days of purchase and to cook them\\n     minimally to get the most food value from this vitamin C-rich food. You’ll\\n ^   appreciate  the  importance  of  variety  and  moderation  in  your  diet  when\\n     you discover that broccoli, which possesses two cancer-preventing proper-\\n     ties, also can inhibit thyroid hormone if consumed in excess.\\n             You  will  also  recognize  that  not  all  wholesome  foods  are  good  for\\n     all  folks.  Sometimes  a  health  condition  will  render  a  food  unsuitable  for\\n ?   you. For example, beans might be restricted for those with gout and certain\\n     greens may be limited for those who must stick to a low-sodium diet. Then\\n     too,  there  are  possible  interactions—both  adverse  and  advantageous—\\n     between  certain  foods  and  nutrients  or  medications.  For  example,  citrus\\n     fruits are recommended accompaniments for iron-rich vegetables and meats\\n\\n                                                                                             ix', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

I am constantly impressed by the quality of\\n]\\n     her work and delighted that she emphasizes science-based facts instead of the\\n     lore and half-baked truths that are so rampant when it comes to food and diet\\n     and the way they affect health and disease. There are far too few accredited\\n     experts to invest time and effort in “communicating” to the public the results\\n 1   of the findings in their field. So it is up to others to do that job, and with this\\n     book Ms. Rinzler shows again that she is up to that challenge.\\n             The New Complete Book of Food is a well-ordered and well-documented\\n     compendium of useful and factual data on what is found in the proverbial\\n [   pantry of humankind. In its 113 chapters the reader will find encyclopedic\\n     information on individual species, such as apples, bananas, carrots, dates,\\n     and so on, and on pluralistic items, such as distilled spirits, fish, game meat,\\n     cultured milk, poultry, and vegetable oils. Most foods covered are true agri-\\n 8   cultural products, but manufactured items are also described, notably beer,\\n     cheese, coffee, gelatin, sugar, wine, and wheat cereals.\\n             The  author  is  very  systematic  in  displaying  each  entry.  Primary\\n     emphasis is on nutrition, followed by household and culinary aspects, and\\n     then  up-to-date  medical  information,  complete  with  references.  General\\n /   readers  may  want  to  browse  and  pick;  professionals,  such  as  food  scien-\\n     tists, nutritionists, dieticians, chefs, and medical practitioners, will consult\\n     this book for specific data they may need at a critical time. For example,\\n     how  should  a  food  be  properly  purchased,  stored,  and  processed?  What\\n w   happens during cooking or other processing? Which is the most nutritious\\n     way to serve a food? And what are a food’s medical or other benefits and\\n     its possible adverse reactions?\\n             Health-conscious  readers  should  value  this  handbook  as  much  as\\n     The Merck Manual of Medical Information. If it behooves us to know how the\\n ^   human body functions, it is equally important to know about the food that\\n     goes into it. Indeed, there is much in this book that would pass as effec-\\n     tive food-safety education. And the home economist/economizer or frugal\\n     gourmet will find ample advice on stretching the food dollar.\\n ?

In  the\\n     carotene makes plant foods look good but is almost certainly not protec-\\n /   tive; fruit juice is loaded with sugar and too much is, well, too much; folic\\n     acid does lower the risk of birth defects but doesn’t influence the chances\\n     of a second coronary event.\\n             Another  major  change  in  nutrition  science  is  how  we  measure  the\\n w   specific  amounts  of  the  various  nutrients  we  require  to  maintain  opti-\\n     mum  health.  Eight  years  ago,  food  scientists  commonly  used  the  term\\n     recommended dietary allowance (RDA) to signify healthful quantities of\\n     vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients such as protein, fat, carbohydrates,\\n ^   and  dietary  fiber.  Today,  a  new  umbrella  term—dietary  reference  intake\\n     (DRI)—includes three different measurements:\\n             u   The  Recommended  Dietary  Allowance  (RDA)  is  a  scientifically\\n                 established daily level of a nutrient known to meet the nutri-\\n ?               tional needs of as many as 98 percent of healthy individuals.\\n                 One example of an RDA is the 90 mg per day of vitamin C\\n                 recommended for healthy adult males.\\n             u   The Adequate Intake (AI) is a daily quantity assigned to nutri-\\n                 ents for which there is not yet enough evidence to establish\\n\\n                                                                                          xiii', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

For  example,  in  July\\n     2008 when my husband had blood drawn for testing before surgery, Michael-Angelo Cassa,\\n     the registered nurse who drew the sample, had a stack of pamphlets on his desk describing\\n     a connection between food allergies and latex allergy. Food and latex linked? Who knew?\\n     Now, thanks to Mr. Cassa and his handy pamphlets, I do—and so do you.\\n\\n     Think of a grapefruit. Think of an aspirin. Now think how similar they are.\\n            Both  can  make  you  feel  better:  the  aspirin  by  relieving  a  headache,  the  grapefruit\\n     by curing (or preventing) scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin C. Both have\\n     side  effects  (the  aspirin  may  make  your  stomach  bleed;  the  grapefruit  may  set  off  allergic\\n     sensitivity).  Both  interact  with  drugs  (the  aspirin  with  “blood-thinners,”  the  grapefruit\\n     with—aspirin).\\n            In fact, they’re both health products.\\n            There’s  nothing  new  in  that,  of  course.  Food  has  always  been  used  as  medicine.\\n     Ancient  Romans  sterilized  wounds  with  wine.  Ancient  Egyptians  used  honey  to  speed\\n     healing. Aztecs regarded chocolate as an aphrodisiac. Jewish grandmothers cured colds with\\n     chicken soup. Italian grandmothers used olive oil liberally to keep their brood in trim.\\n            What is new is that today we understand the science behind the folk remedy. Wine\\n     sterilizes  with  alcohol.  Hydrophilic  (“water  loving”)  honey  sops  up  liquids,  kills  bacteria,\\n     and nourishes new cell growth. Chocolate’s methylxanthine stimulants (caffeine, theophyl-\\n     line, theobromine) are mood elevators. Steam from chicken soup (and the hot liquid itself)\\n     stimulates a flow of natural secretions to clear the nasal passages. Pasta has fiber and B vita-\\n     mins, and olive oil is rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fatty acids. In short, what was\\n     once folklore is now nutritional good sense. And that’s the point of this book.\\n\\n    What You Will Find in This Book\\n    The information in this book is organized into a series of entries arranged in alphabetical\\n    order.

Foods\\n        that derive 30 to 50 percent of their calories from fat are  moderate. Foods that derive\\n        more than 50 percent of their calories from fat are high. NOTE: Fats have nine calories\\n        per gram, so a food with 30 percent of its calories from fat has about three grams fat\\n        per 100 calories. A food with 50 percent of its calories from fat has six grams fat per\\n        100 calories.

What kinds of fiber does\\n     the food contain? Are its fats primarily saturated fatty acids or unsaturated ones?

Does the food\\n     contain antinutrients, such as the avidin in raw egg white that inactivates the nutrient biotin?\\n     Does it contain naturally occurring toxins such as solanine, the nerve poison in the green parts\\n     of potatoes or tomatoes? You’ll find the answers to this kind of question here.

IU, another nutritional abbreviation,\\n     stands for international units, a term used to describe quantities of vitamins A and D.\\n             Unless otherwise noted, the RDAs (recommended dietary allowances) and AIs (ade-\\n     quate intakes) listed in this section are for healthy adults, men and women ages 19 to 50.

Sort out the facts under storing this food.\\n        Ready to eat? Then it’s time to begin preparing this food. This section tells you how to\\nhandle food you are about to cook or serve. With the pertinent science, of course. For example:\\nwe tear greens at the very last minute to keep them crisp—and to prevent the loss of vitamin\\nC when torn cells release the anti-C enzyme ascorbic acid oxidase. We beat egg whites in a\\ncopper bowl because copper ions flaking off the surface stabilize the egg foam. We slice raw\\nonions under running water to dilute sulfur compounds that make our eyes water.\\n        What happens when you cook this food? Lots. Heating crystallizes sugars and proteins to\\nform  a  flavorful  crust.  Aroma  molecules  move  more  quickly  to  produce  enticing  aromas.\\nPigments combine with oxygen or other chemicals, turning brown or olive drab. These reac-\\ntions are familiar; here’s the “how” and “why.”\\n        And there’s the question of how other kinds of processing affect this food. Processing often\\nchanges a food’s texture, and it may alter the nutritional value. Defrosted frozen potatoes\\nand carrots are usually mushy; canned vegetables have less vitamin C. Sometimes, process-\\ning even makes food potentially hazardous: Dried fruit treated with sulfur compounds may\\nbe life-threatening to people sensitive to sulfites.\\n        This leads quite naturally to the medical uses and/or benefits of food. The information in\\nthis section comes from sources current as the book is written, but research in this area is so\\nnew and expanding so rapidly that it must always be regarded as a work in progress rather\\nthan a final conclusion.

When an apple is damaged the injured cells release polyphenoloxi-\\ndase,  an  enzyme  that  hastens  the  oxidation  of  phenols  in  the  apple,  producing  brownish\\npigments that darken the fruit. It’s easy to check loose apples; if you buy them packed in a\\nplastic bag, turn the bag upside down and examine the fruit.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nStore  apples  in  the  refrigerator.  Cool  storage  keeps  them  from  losing  the  natural  moisture\\nthat makes them crisp. It also keeps them from turning brown inside, near the core, a phe-\\nnomenon that occurs when apples are stored at warm temperatures. Apples can be stored in\\na cool, dark cabinet with plenty of circulating air.\\n        Check the apples from time to time. They store well, but the longer the storage, the\\ngreater  the  natural  loss  of  moisture  and  the  more  likely  the  chance  that  even  the  crispest\\napple will begin to taste mealy.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nDon’t peel or slice an apple until you are ready to use it. When you cut into the apple, you\\ntear its cells, releasing polyphenoloxidase, an enzyme that darkens the fruit. Acid inactivates\\npolyphenoloxidase, so you can slow the browning (but not stop it completely) by dipping\\nraw sliced and/or peeled apples into a solution of lemon juice and water or vinegar and water\\nor  by  mixing  them  with  citrus  fruits  in  a  fruit  salad.  Polyphenoloxidase  also  works  more\\nslowly in the cold, but storing peeled apples in the refrigerator is much less effective than\\nimmersing them in an acid bath.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nWhen  you  cook  an  unpeeled  apple,  insoluble  cellulose  and  lignin  will  hold  the  peel  intact\\nthrough all normal cooking. The flesh of the apple, though, will fall apart as the pectin in its\\ncell walls dissolves and the water inside its cells swells, rupturing the cell walls and turning\\nthe apples into applesauce.

Cloudy\\napple  juice  is  made  simply  by  chopping  or  shredding  apples  and  then  pressing  out  and\\nstraining the juice. Clear apple juice is cloudy juice filtered to remove solid particles and then\\ntreated with enzymes to eliminate starches and the soluble fiber pectin. Since 2000, follow-\\ning several deaths attributed to unpasteurized apple juice contaminated with E. coli O157:\\nH7, the FDA has required that all juices sold in the United States be pasteurized to inactivate\\nharmful organisms such as bacteria and mold. Note: “Hard cider” is a mildly alcoholic bever-\\nage created when natural enzyme action converts the sugars in apple juice to alcohol; “non-\\nalcohol cider” is another name for plain apple juice.\\nDrying.      To keep apple slices from turning brown as they dry, apples may be treated with\\nsulfur compounds that may cause serious allergic reactions in people allergic to sulfites.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nAs an antidiarrheal.         The pectin in apple is a natural antidiarrheal that helps solidify stool.\\nShaved raw apple is sometimes used as a folk remedy for diarrhea, and purified pectin is an\\ningredient in many over-the-counter antidiarrheals.\\nLower cholesterol levels.        Soluble fiber (pectin) may interfere with the absorption of dietary\\nfats, including cholesterol. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown, but\\none theory is that the pectins in the apple may form a gel in your stomach that sops up fats\\nand cholesterol, carrying them out of your body as waste.\\nPotential  anticarcinogenic  effects.        A  report  in  the  April  2008  issue  of  the  journal  Nutrition\\nfrom a team of researchers at the University of Kaiserslautern, in Germany, suggests that\\nseveral  natural  chemicals  in  apples,  including  butyrate  (produced  naturally  when  the\\npectin in apples and apple juice is metabolized) reduce the risk of cancer of the colon by\\nnourishing and protecting the mucosa (lining) of the colon.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nIntestinal gas.      For some children, drinking excess amounts of apple juice produces intestinal\\ndiscomfort (gas or diarrhea) when bacteria living naturally in the stomach ferment the sugars\\nin the juice.

To keep it as crisp as possible, wrap it in a damp\\npaper towel and then put the whole package into a plastic bag. Keeping asparagus cool helps\\nit hold onto its vitamins. At 32°F, asparagus will retain all its folic acid for at least two weeks\\nand nearly 80 percent of its vitamin C for up to five days; at room temperature, it would lose\\nup to 75 percent of its folic acid in three days and 50 percent of the vitamin C in 24 hours.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nThe white part of the fresh green asparagus stalk is woody and tasteless, so you can bend\\nthe stalk and snap it right at the line where the green begins to turn white. If the skin is very\\nthick, peel it, but save the parings for soup stock.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nChlorophyll,  the  pigment  that  makes  green  vegetables  green,  is  sensitive  to  acids.  When\\nyou heat asparagus, its chlorophyll will react chemically with acids in the asparagus or in\\nthe  cooking  water  to  form  pheophytin,  which  is  brown.  As  a  result,  cooked  asparagus  is\\nolive-drab.\\n        You can prevent this chemical reaction by cooking the asparagus so quickly that there\\nis no time for the chlorophyll to react with acids, or by cooking it in lots of water (which\\nwill dilute the acids), or by leaving the lid off the pot so that the volatile acids can float off\\ninto the air.\\n        Cooking also changes the texture of asparagus: water escapes from its cells and they\\ncollapse. Adding salt to the cooking liquid slows the loss of moisture.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nCanning.       The  intense  heat  of  canning  makes  asparagus  soft,  robs  it  of  its  bright  green\\ncolor,  and  reduces  the  vitamin  A,  B,  and  C  content  by  at  least  half.  (White  asparagus,\\nwhich  is  bleached  to  remove  the  green  color,  contains  about  5  percent  of  the  vitamin  A\\nin fresh asparagus.) With its liquid, canned asparagus, green or white, contains about 90\\ntimes the sodium in fresh asparagus (348 mg in 3.5 oz. canned against 4 mg in 3.5 oz. fresh\\nboiled asparagus).\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nLower risk of some birth defects.

When the skin is yellow-green, 40 percent of its carbohydrates\\n     are starch; when the skin is fully yellow and the banana is ripe, only 8 per-\\n /   cent of the carbohydrates are still starch. The rest (91 percent) have broken\\n     down into sugars—glucose, fructose, sucrose, the most plentiful sugar in\\n     the  fruit.  Its  high  sugar  content  makes  the  banana,  in  its  self-contained\\n     packet, a handy energy source.\\n             Bananas are a high-fiber food with insoluble cellulose and lignin in\\n w   the tiny seeds and soluble pectins in the flesh.

Raw bananas are richer in potassium than cooked\\nbananas; heating depletes potassium.\\n\\nDiets That May Restrict or Exclude This Food\\n* * *\\n\\nBuying This Food\\nLook  for:     Bananas  that  will  be  good  when  you  plan  to  eat  them.  Bananas  with  brown\\nspecks on the skin are ripe enough to eat immediately. Bananas with creamy yellow skin\\nwill be ready in a day or two. Bananas with mostly yellow skin and a touch of green at either\\nend can be ripened at home and used in two or three days.\\nAvoid:     Overripe bananas whose skin has turned brown or split open. A grayish yellow skin\\nmeans that the fruit has been damaged by cold storage. Bananas with soft spots under the\\nskin may be rotten.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nStore  bananas  that  aren’t  fully  ripe  at  room  temperature  for  a  day  or  two.  Like  avocados,\\nbananas  are  picked  green,  shipped  hard  to  protect  them  from  damage  en  route  and  then\\nsprayed with ethylene gas to ripen them quickly. Untreated bananas release ethylene natu-\\nrally to ripen the fruit and turn its starches to sugar, but natural ripening takes time. Artificial\\nripening  happens  so  quickly  that  there  is  no  time  for  the  starches  to  turn  into  sugar.  The\\nbananas look ripe but they may taste bland and starchy. A few days at room temperature\\nwill give the starches a chance to change into sugars.\\n        Store ripe bananas in the refrigerator. The cold air will slow (but not stop) the natural\\nenzyme action that ripens and eventually rots the fruit if you leave it at room temperature.\\nCold  storage  will  darken  the  banana’s  skin,  since  the  chill  damages  cells  in  the  peel  and\\nreleases  polyphenoloxidase,  an  enzyme  that  converts  phenols  in  the  banana  peel  to  dark\\nbrown compounds, but the fruit inside will remain pale and tasty for several days.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nDo not slice or peel bananas until you are ready to use them. When you cut into the fruit,\\nyou tear its cell walls, releasing polyphenoloxidase, an enzyme that hastens the oxidation of\\nphenols in the banana, producing brown pigments that darken the fruit. (Chilling a banana\\nproduces  the  same  reaction  because  the  cold  damages  cells  in  the  banana  peel.)  You  can\\nslow the browning (but not stop it completely) by dipping raw sliced or peeled bananas into\\na solution of lemon juice or vinegar and water or by mixing the slices with citrus fruits in\\na fruit salad. Overripe, discolored bananas can be used in baking, where the color doesn’t\\nmatter and their intense sweetness is an asset.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Drying  removes  water  and  concentrates  the  nutrients  and  calories  in  bananas.\\nBananas may be treated with compounds such as sulfur dioxide to inhibit polyphenoloxi-\\ndase and keep the bananas from browning as they dry.

Various  nutrition  studies  have  attested  to  the  power  of  adequate\\npotassium to keep blood pressure within safe levels. For example, in the 1990s, data from\\nthe long-running Harvard School of Public Health/Health Professionals Follow-Up Study of\\nmale doctors showed that a diet rich in high-potassium foods such as bananas, oranges, and\\nplantain may reduce the risk of stroke. In the study, the men who ate the higher number\\nof potassium-rich foods (an average of nine servings a day) had a risk of stroke 38 percent\\nlower than that of men who consumed fewer than four servings a day. In 2008, a similar\\nsurvey at the Queen’s Medical Center (Honolulu) showed a similar protective effect among\\nmen and women using diuretic drugs (medicines that increase urination and thus the loss\\nof potassium).\\nImproved  mood.        Bananas  and  plantains  are  both  rich  in  serotonin,  dopamine,  and  other\\nnatural  mood-elevating  neurotransmitters—natural  chemicals  that  facilitate  the  transmis-\\nsion of impulses along nerve cells.\\nPotassium benefits.        Because potassium is excreted in urine, potassium-rich foods are often\\nrecommended for people taking diuretics. In addition, a diet rich in potassium (from food)\\nis associated with a lower risk of stroke. A 1998 Harvard School of Public Health analysis\\nof  data  from  the  long-running  Health  Professionals  Study  shows  38  percent  fewer  strokes\\namong  men  who  ate  nine  servings  of  high  potassium  foods  a  day  vs.  those  who  ate  less\\nthan four servings. Among men with high blood pressure, taking a daily 1,000 mg potas-\\nsium supplement—about the amount of potassium in one banana—reduced the incidence of\\nstroke by 60 percent.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Latex is a milky fluid obtained from the rubber tree and used to make\\nmedical and surgical products such as condoms and protective latex gloves, as well as rub-\\nber  bands,  balloons,  and  toys;  elastic  used  in  clothing;  pacifiers  and  baby  bottle-nipples;\\nchewing  gum;  and  various  adhesives.  Some  of  the  proteins  in  latex  are  allergenic,  known\\nto  cause  reactions  ranging  from  mild  to  potentially  life-threatening.  Some  of  the  proteins\\nfound naturally in latex also occur naturally in foods from plants such as avocados, bananas,\\nchestnuts, kiwi fruit, tomatoes, and food and diet sodas sweetened with aspartame. Persons\\nsensitive to these foods are likely to be sensitive to latex as well.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are drugs used to treat\\n depression. They inactivate naturally occurring enzymes in your body that metabolize tyra-\\n mine, a substance found in many fermented or aged foods. Tyramine constricts blood vessels\\n and increases blood pressure. If you eat a food containing tyramine while you are taking an\\n MAO inhibitor, you cannot effectively eliminate the tyramine from your body. The result\\n may be a hypertensive crisis.

Well protected,\\nit will keep for several months with no loss of nutrients.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nPick over the barley and discard any damaged or darkened grains.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nStarch consists of molecules of the complex carbohydrates amylose and amylopectin packed\\ninto a starch granule. When you cook barley in water, its starch granules absorb water mol-\\necules, swell, and soften. When the temperature of the liquid reaches approximately 140°F,\\nthe amylose and amylopectin molecules inside the granules relax and unfold, breaking some\\nof  their  internal  bonds  (bonds  between  atoms  on  the  same  molecule)  and  forming  new\\nbonds between atoms on different molecules. The result is a network that traps and holds\\nwater molecules. The starch granules swell and the barley becomes soft and bulky. If you\\ncontinue to cook the barley, the starch granules will rupture, releasing some of the amylose\\nand amylopectin molecules inside. These molecules will attract and immobilize some of the\\nwater molecules in the liquid, which is why a little barley added to a soup or stew will make\\nthe soup or stew thicker.\\n       The B vitamins in barley are water-soluble. You can save them by serving the barley\\nwith the liquid in which it was cooked.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nPearling.    Pearled  barley  is  barley  from  which  the  outer  layer  has  been  removed.  Milling,\\nthe process by which barley is turned into flour, also removes the outer coating (bran) of the\\ngrain. Since most of the B vitamins and fiber are concentrated in the bran, both pearled and\\nmilled barley are lower in nutrients and fiber than whole barley.\\nMalting.     After barley is harvested, the grain may be left to germinate, a natural chemical\\nprocess during which complex carbohydrates in the grain (starches and beta-glucans) change\\ninto sugar. The grain, now called malted barley, is used as the base for several fermented and\\ndistilled alcohol beverages, including beer and whiskey.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nTo  reduce  cholesterol  levels.      The  soluble  gums  and  pectins  in  barley  appear  to  lower  the\\namount of cholesterol circulating in your blood. There are currently two theories to explain\\nhow this might work. The first theory is that the pectins form a gel in your stomach that\\nsops up fats and keeps them from being absorbed by your body. The second is that bacteria\\nliving in your gut may feed on the beta-glucans in the barley to produce short-chain fatty', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Researchers\\nat Tulane University examined the results of 12 controlled studies in which 16,958 patients\\nwith preexisting cardiovascular disease were given either folic acid supplements or placebos\\n(“look-alike” pills with no folic acid) for at least six months. The scientists, who found no\\nreduction in the risk of further heart disease or overall death rates among those taking folic\\nacid,  concluded  that  further  studies  will  be  required  to  verify  whether  taking  folic  acid\\nsupplements reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nFood poisoning:       Reacting to an outbreak of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 food poisoning\\nassociated with eating raw alfalfa sprouts, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warn-\\ning in 1998 and again in summer 1999, cautioning those at high risk of food-borne illness\\nnot to eat any raw sprouts.

The gums and pectins in dried beans and peas appear\\n to lower blood levels of cholesterol. Currently there are two theories to explain how this may\\n happen. The first theory is that the pectins in the beans form a gel in your stomach that sops\\n up fats and keeps them from being absorbed by your body. The second is that bacteria in\\n the gut feed on the bean fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids that inhibit the production\\n of cholesterol in your liver.\\n As a source of carbohydrates for people with diabetes.                Beans are digested very slowly, produc-\\ning only a gradual rise in blood-sugar levels. As a result, the body needs less insulin to control\\nblood sugar after eating beans than after eating some other high-carbohydrate foods (such\\nas bread or potato). In studies at the University of Kentucky, a bean, whole-grain, vegetable,\\nand fruit-rich diet developed at the University of Toronto enabled patients with type 1 dia-\\nbetes (who  do  not produce  any insulin  themselves)  to  cut  their daily  insulin  intake  by  38\\npercent. Patients with type 2 diabetes (who can produce some insulin) were able to reduce\\ntheir insulin injections by 98 percent. This diet is in line with the nutritional guidelines of\\nthe  American  Diabetes  Association,  but  people  with  diabetes  should  always  consult  with\\ntheir doctors and/or dietitians before altering their diet.\\nAs a diet aid.       Although beans are high in calories, they are also high in bulk (fiber); even\\n a  small  serving  can  make  you  feel  full.  And,  because  they  are  insulin-sparing,  they  delay\\n the rise in insulin levels that makes us feel hungry again soon after eating. Research at the\\n University of Toronto suggests the insulin-sparing effect may last for several hours after you\\n eat the beans, perhaps until after the next meal.\\n\\n Adverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n Intestinal gas.      All legumes (beans and peas) contain raffinose and stachyose, complex sug-\\n ars that human beings cannot digest. The sugars sit in the gut and are fermented by intestinal\\n bacteria which then produce gas that distends the intestines and makes us uncomfortable.\\n You  can  lessen  this  effect  by  covering  the  beans  with  water,  bringing  them  to  a  boil  for\\n three to five minutes, and then setting them aside to soak for four to six hours so that the\\n indigestible sugars leach out in the soaking water, which can be discarded. Alternatively, you\\n may soak the beans for four hours in nine cups of water for every cup of beans, discard the\\n soaking water, and add new water as your recipe directs. Then cook the beans; drain them\\n before serving.\\n Production  of  uric  acid.      Purines are the natural metabolic by-products of protein metabo-\\nlism  in  the  body.

The fat should be white, not yellow.\\n        Choose lean cuts of beef with as little internal marbling (streaks of fat) as possible. The\\nleanest cuts are flank steak and round steak; rib steaks, brisket, and chuck have the most fat.\\nUSDA grading, which is determined by the maturity of the animal and marbling in meat, is\\nalso a guide to fat content. U.S. prime has more marbling than U.S. choice, which has more\\nmarbling than U.S. good. All are equally nutritious; the difference is how tender they are,\\nwhich depends on how much fat is present.\\n        Choose the cut of meat that is right for your recipe. Generally, the cuts from the cen-\\nter of the animal’s back—the rib, the T-Bone, the porterhouse steaks—are the most tender.\\nThey can be cooked by dry heat—broiling, roasting, pan-frying. Cuts from around the legs,\\nthe underbelly, and the neck—the shank, the brisket, the round—contain muscles used for\\nmovement. They must be tenderized by stewing or boiling, the long, moist cooking methods\\nthat break down the connective tissue that makes meat tough.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nRefrigerate raw beef immediately, carefully wrapped to prevent its drippings from contami-\\nnating other foods. Refrigeration prolongs the freshness of beef by slowing the natural multi-\\nplication of bacteria on the meat surface. Unchecked, these bacteria will convert proteins and\\nother substances on the surface of the meat to a slimy film and change meat’s sulfur-contain-\\ning amino acids methionine and cystine into smelly chemicals called mercaptans. When the\\nmercaptans combine with myoglobin, they produce the greenish pigment that gives spoiled\\nmeat its characteristic unpleasant appearance.\\n        Fresh ground beef, with many surfaces where bacteria can live, should be used within\\n24 to 48 hours. Other cuts of beef may stay fresh in the refrigerator for three to five days.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nTrim  the  beef  carefully.  By  judiciously  cutting  away  all  visible  fat  you  can  significantly\\nreduce the amount of fat and cholesterol in each serving.\\n        When you are done, clean all utensils thoroughly with soap and hot water. Wash your\\ncutting board, wood or plastic, with hot water, soap, and a bleach-and-water solution.

Because beef’s only sugars are the small amounts\\nof glycogen in the muscles, we add sugars in marinades or basting liquids that may also con-\\ntain acids (vinegar, lemon juice, wine) to break down muscle fibers and tenderize the meat.\\n(Browning has one minor nutritional drawback. It breaks amino acids on the surface of the\\nmeat into smaller compounds that are no longer useful proteins.)\\n        When  beef  is  cooked,  it  loses  water  and  shrinks.  Its  pigments,  which  combine  with\\noxygen, are denatured (broken into fragments) by the heat and turn brown, the natural color\\nof well-done meat.\\n        At the same time, the fats in the beef are oxidized. Oxidized fats, whether formed in\\ncooking or when the cooked meat is stored in the refrigerator, give cooked meat a character-\\nistic warmed-over flavor. Cooking and storing meat under a blanket of antioxidants—catsup\\nor  a  gravy  made  of  tomatoes,  peppers,  and  other  vitamin  C-rich  vegetables—reduces  the\\noxidation  of  fats  and  the  intensity  of  warmed-over  flavor.  Meat  reheated  in  a  microwave\\noven also has less warmed-over flavor.\\n        An obvious nutritional benefit of cooking is the fact that heat lowers the fat content of\\nbeef by liquifying the fat so it can run off the meat. One concrete example of how well this\\nworks  comes  from  a  comparison  of  the  fat  content  in  regular  and  extra-lean  ground  beef.\\nAccording to research at the University of Missouri in 1985, both kinds of beef lose mass\\nwhen  cooked,  but  the  lean  beef  loses  water  and  the  regular  beef  loses  fat  and  cholesterol.\\nThus, while regular raw ground beef has about three times as much fat (by weight) as raw\\nground extra-lean beef, their fat varies by only 5 percent after broiling.\\n        To reduce the amount of fat in ground beef, heat the beef in a pan until it browns. Then\\nput  the  beef  in  a  colander,  and  pour  one  cup  of  warm  water  over  the  beef.  Repeat  with  a\\nsecond cup of warm water to rinse away fat melted by heating the beef. Use the ground beef\\nin sauce and other dishes that do not require it to hold together.\\n        Finally,  cooking  makes  beef  safer  by  killing  Salmonella  and  other  organisms  in  the\\nmeat. As a result, cooking also serves as a natural preservative. According to the USDA, large\\npieces of fresh beef can be refrigerated for two or three days, then cooked and held safely for\\nanother day or two because the heat of cooking has reduced the number of bacteria on the\\nsurface of the meat and temporarily interrupted the natural cycle of deterioration.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nAging.      Hanging fresh meat exposed to the air, in a refrigerated room, reduces the moisture\\ncontent and shrinks the meat slightly. As the meat ages enzymes break down muscle pro-\\nteins, “tenderizing” the beef.\\nCanning.       Canned beef does not develop a warmed-over flavor because the high tempera-\\ntures in canning food and the long cooking process alter proteins in the meat so that they act', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Once the can is open, however, the meat should be protected from oxygen\\nthat will change the flavor of the beef.\\nCuring.      Salt-curing preserves meat through osmosis, the physical reaction in which liquids\\nflow across a membrane, such as the wall of a cell, from a less dense to a more dense solution.\\nThe salt or sugar used in curing dissolves in the liquid on the surface of the meat to make a\\nsolution that is more dense than the liquid inside the cells of the meat. Water flows out of\\nthe meat and out of the cells of any microorganisms living on the meat, killing the microor-\\nganisms and protecting the meat from bacterial damage. Salt-cured meat is much higher in\\nsodium than fresh meat.\\nFreezing.      When you freeze beef, the water inside its cells freezes into sharp ice crystals that\\ncan puncture cell membranes. When the beef thaws, moisture (and some of the B vitamins)\\nwill leak out through these torn cell walls. The loss of moisture is irreversible, but some of\\nthe vitamins can be saved by using the drippings when the meat is cooked. Freezing may\\nalso  cause  freezer  burn—dry  spots  left  when  moisture  evaporates  from  the  surface  of  the\\nmeat. Waxed freezer paper is designed specifically to hold the moisture in meat; plastic wrap\\nand aluminum foil are less effective. NOTE: Commercially prepared beef, which is frozen\\nvery quickly at very low temperatures, is less likely to show changes in texture.\\nIrradiation.      Irradiation  makes  meat  safer  by  exposing  it  to  gamma  rays,  the  kind  of  high-\\nenergy ionizing radiation that kills living cells, including bacteria. Irradiation does not change\\nthe way meat looks, feels or tastes, or make the food radioactive, but it does alter the structure\\nof some naturally occurring chemicals in beef, breaking molecules apart to form new com-\\npounds called radiolytic products (RP). About 90 percent of RPs are also found in nonirradiated\\nfoods. The rest, called unique radiolytic products (URP), are found only in irradiated foods.\\nThere is currently no evidence to suggest that URPs are harmful; irradiation is an approved\\ntechnique in more than 37 countries around the world, including the United States.\\nSmoking.       Hanging cured or salted meat over an open fire slowly dries the meat, kills micro-\\norganisms on its surface, and gives the meat a rich, “smoky” flavor that varies with the wood\\nused in the fire. Meats smoked over an open fire are exposed to carcinogenic chemicals in\\nthe smoke, including a-benzopyrene. Meats treated with “artificial smoke flavoring” are not,\\nsince the flavoring is commercially treated to remove tar and a-benzopyrene.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nTreating and/or preventing iron deficiency.              Without meat in the diet, it is virtually impossible\\nfor  an  adult  woman  to  meet  her  iron  requirement  without  supplements.

Like other foods from animals, beef contains cholesterol and\\nsaturated fats that increase the amount of cholesterol circulating in your blood, raising your\\nrisk of heart disease. To reduce the risk of heart disease, the National Cholesterol Education\\nProject recommends following the Step I and Step II diets.\\n       The Step I diet provides no more than 30 percent of total daily calories from fat, no\\nmore  than  10  percent  of  total  daily  calories  from  saturated  fat,  and  no  more  than  300  mg\\nof cholesterol per day. It is designed for healthy people whose cholesterol is in the range of\\n200–239 mg/dL.\\n       The Step II diet provides 25–35 percent of total calories from fat, less than 7 percent\\nof total calories from saturated fat, up to 10 percent of total calories from polyunsaturated\\nfat, up to 20 percent of total calories from monounsaturated fat, and less than 300 mg cho-\\nlesterol per day.

According the American Institute for Cancer Research, a diet\\nhigh in red meat (beef, lamb, pork) increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer by 15\\npercent for every 1.5 ounces over 18 ounces consumed per week. In 2007, the National Can-\\ncer Institute released data from a survey of 500,000 people, ages 50 to 71, who participated\\nin an eight-year AARP diet and health study identifying a higher risk of developing cancer\\nof the esophagus, liver, lung, and pancreas among people eating large amounts of red meats\\nand processed meats.\\nFood-borne  illness.       Improperly  cooked  meat  contaminated  with  E.  coli  O157:H7  has  been\\nlinked to a number of fatalities in several parts of the United States.

Like  wine,  beer\\n     retains small amounts of some nutrients present in the food from which\\nw    it was made.\\n     *    Because  yeasts  cannot  digest  the  starches  in  grains,  the  grains  to  be  used  in\\n^        making beer and ale are allowed to germinate (“malt”). When it is time to make\\n         the  beer  or  ale,  the  malted  grain  is  soaked  in  water,  forming  a  mash  in  which\\n         the starches are split into simple sugars that can be digested (fermented) by the\\n         yeasts.

Very low temperatures immo-\\nbilize the molecules that give beer and ale their flavor and aroma.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nWhen beer is heated (in a stew or as a basting liquid), the alcohol evaporates but the flavor-\\ning agents remain intact. Alcohol, an acid, reacts with metal ions from an aluminum or iron\\npot to form dark compounds that discolor the pot or the dish you are cooking in. To prevent\\nthis, prepare dishes made with beer in glass or enameled pots.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\n* * *\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nReduced risk of heart attack.           Data from the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention\\nStudy 1, a 12-year survey of more than 1 million Americans in 25 states, shows that men\\nwho take one drink a day have a 21 percent lower risk of heart attack and a 22 percent lower\\nrisk of stroke than men who do not drink at all. Women who have up to one drink a day also\\nreduce their risk of heart attack. Numerous later studies have confirmed these findings.\\nLower  risk  of  stroke.       In  January  1999,  the  results  of  a  677-person  study  published  by\\nresearchers  at  New  York  Presbyterian  Hospital-Columbia  University  showed  that  moder-\\nate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of stroke due to a blood clot in the brain among\\nolder  people  (average  age:  70).  How  the  alcohol  prevents  stroke  is  still  unknown,  but  it  is\\nclear that moderate use of alcohol is a key. Heavy drinkers (those who consume more than\\nseven drinks a day) have a higher risk of stroke. People who once drank heavily, but cut their\\nconsumption to moderate levels, can also reduce their risk of stroke. Numerous later studies\\nhave confirmed these findings.\\nLower  cholesterol  levels.       Beverage  alcohol  decreases  the  body’s  production  and  storage  of\\nlow-density  lipoproteins  (LDLs),  the  protein  and  fat  particles  that  carry  cholesterol  into\\nyour  arteries.  As  a  result,  people  who  drink  moderately  tend  to  have  lower  cholesterol\\nlevels  and  higher  levels  of  high  density  lipoproteins  (HDLs),  the  fat  and  protein  particles\\nthat  carry  cholesterol  out  of  the  body.  The  USDA/Health  and  Human  Services  Dietary\\nGuidelines for Americans defines moderation as two drinks a day for a man, one drink a\\nday for a woman.\\nStimulating  the  appetite.

Alcohol dilates the capillaries (the tiny blood vessels just under the\\nskin), and moderate amounts of alcoholic beverages produce a pleasant flush that temporar-\\nily warms the drinker. But drinking is not an effective way to warm up in cold weather since\\nthe warm blood that flows up to the capillaries will cool down on the surface of your skin\\nand make you even colder when it circulates back into the center of your body. Then an alco-\\nhol flush will make you perspire, so that you lose more heat. Excessive amounts of beverage\\nalcohol may depress the mechanism that regulates body temperature.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nIncreased risk of breast cancer.          In 2008, scientists at the National Cancer Institute released\\ndata from a seven-year survey of more than 100,000 postmenopausal women showing that\\neven moderate drinking (one to two drinks a day) may increase by 32 percent a woman’s\\nrisk of developing estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) and progesterone-receptor positive (PR+)\\nbreast  cancer,  tumors  whose  growth  is  stimulated  by  hormones.  No  such  link  was  found\\nbetween consuming alcohol and the risk of developing ER-/PR- tumors (not fueled by hor-\\nmones). The finding applies to all types of alcohol: beer, wine, and spirits.\\nIncreased risk of oral cancer (cancer of the mouth and throat).                   Numerous studies confirm the\\nAmerican  Cancer  Society’s  warning  that  men  and  women  who  consume  more  than  two\\ndrinks a day are at higher risk of oral cancer than are nondrinkers or people who drink less.\\nNote: The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes one drink as 12 ounces of beer, five ounces\\nof wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.\\nIncreased risk of cancer of the colon and rectum.                In the mid-1990s, studies at the University\\nof Oklahoma suggested that men who drink more than five beers a day are at increased risk\\nof rectal cancer. Later studies suggested that men and women who are heavy beer or spirits\\ndrinkers (but not those who are heavy wine drinkers) have a higher risk of colorectal cancers.\\nFurther studies are required to confirm these findings.\\nFetal  alcohol  syndrome.        Fetal  alcohol  syndrome  is  a  specific  pattern  of  birth  defects—low\\nbirth weight, heart defects, facial malformations, and mental retardation—first recognized\\nin  a  study  of  babies  born  to  alcoholic  women  who  consumed  more  than  six  drinks  a  day\\nwhile  pregnant.  Subsequent  research  has  found  a  consistent  pattern  of  milder  defects  in\\nbabies born to women who consume three to four drinks a day or five drinks on any one\\noccasion while pregnant. To date, there is no evidence of a consistent pattern of birth defects\\nin babies born to women who consume less than one drink a day while pregnant, but two\\nstudies at Columbia University have suggested that as few as two drinks a week while preg-\\nnant may raise a woman’s risk of miscarriage. (“One drink” means 12 ounces of beer, five\\nounces of wine, or 1.25 ounces of distilled spirits.)\\nAlcoholism.

While  moderate  alcohol  consumption  stimulates  appetite,  alcohol  abuse\\ndepresses it. In addition, an alcoholic may drink instead of eating. When an alcoholic does\\neat, excess alcohol in his/her body prevents absorption of nutrients and reduces the ability\\nto synthesize new tissue.\\nHangover.       Alcohol  is  absorbed  from  the  stomach  and  small  intestine  and  carried  by  the\\nbloodstream  to  the  liver,  where  it  is  oxidized  to  acetaldehyde  by  alcohol  dehydrogenase\\n(ADH),  the  enzyme  our  bodies  use  to  metabolize  the  alcohol  we  produce  when  we  digest\\ncarbohydrates.  The  acetaldehyde  is  converted  to  acetyl  coenzyme  A  and  either  eliminated\\nfrom the body or used in the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and body tissues. Although\\nindividuals vary widely in their capacity to metabolize alcohol, on average, normal healthy\\nadults can metabolize the alcohol in one quart of beer in approximately five to six hours. If\\nthey  drink  more  than  that,  they  will  have  more  alcohol  than  the  body’s  natural  supply  of\\nADH can handle. The unmetabolized alcohol will pile up in the bloodstream, interfering with\\nthe  liver’s  metabolic  functions.  Since  alcohol  decreases  the  reabsorption  of  water  from  the\\nkidneys and may inhibit the secretion of an antidiuretic hormone, they will begin to urinate\\ncopiously, losing magnesium, calcium, and zinc but retaining more irritating uric acid. The\\nlevel of lactic acid in the body will increase, making them feel tired and out of sorts; their\\nacid-base balance will be out of kilter; the blood vessels in their heads will swell and throb;\\nand their stomachs, with linings irritated by the alcohol, will ache. The ultimate result is a\\n“hangover”  whose  symptoms  will  disappear  only  when  enough  time  has  passed  to  allow\\ntheir bodies to marshal the ADH needed to metabolize the extra alcohol in their blood.\\nChanges  in  body  temperature.           Alcohol  dilates  capillaries,  tiny  blood  vessels  just  under  the\\nskin, producing a “flush” that temporarily warms the drinker. But drinking is not an effective\\nway to stay warm in cold weather. Warm blood flowing up from the body core to the surface\\ncapillaries is quickly chilled, making you even colder when it circulates back into your organs.\\nIn addition, an alcohol flush triggers perspiration, further cooling your skin. Finally, very large\\namounts of alcohol may actually depress the mechanism that regulates body temperature.\\nImpotence.       Excessive drinking decreases libido (sexual desire) and interferes with the ability\\nto achieve or sustain an erection.\\n“Beer  belly.”     Data  from  a  1995,  12,000  person  study  at  the  University  of  North  Carolina\\nin Chapel Hill show that people who consume at least six beers a week have more rounded\\nabdomens than people who do not drink beer. The question left to be answered is which\\ncame first: the tummy or the drinking.\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol, etc.).

Taken  with  alcohol,  disulfiram  causes  flushing,  nausea,  low  blood\\npressure, faintness, respiratory problems, and confusion. The severity of the reaction gener-\\nally  depends  on  how  much  alcohol  you  drink,  how  much  disulfiram  is  in  your  body,  and\\nhow long ago you took it. Disulfiram is used to help recovering alcoholics avoid alcohol.

Alcohol  slows  the  body’s  metabolism  of  anticoagulants  (blood  thinners)\\nsuch as warfarin (Coumadin), intensifying the effect of the drugs and increasing the risk of\\nside effects such as spontaneous nosebleeds.\\nAntidepressants.        Alcohol  may  increase  the  sedative  effects  of  antidepressants.  Drinking\\nalcohol  while  you  are  taking  a  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)  inhibitor  is  especially  hazard-\\nous. MAO inhibitors inactivate naturally occurring enzymes in your body that metabolize\\ntyramine, a substance found in many fermented or aged foods. Tyramine constricts blood\\nvessels and increases blood pressure. If you eat a food containing tyramine while you are\\ntaking an MAO inhibitor, you cannot effectively eliminate the tyramine from your body.\\nThe result may be a hypertensive crisis. Ordinarily, fermentation of beer and ale does not\\nproduce tyramine, but some patients have reported tyramine reactions after drinking some\\nimported beers.

The RDA for folate is\\n400 mcg for healthy adult men and women, 600 mcg for pregnant women, and 500 mcg for\\nwomen who are nursing. Taking folate supplements before becoming pregnant and continu-\\ning through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the risk of cleft palate; taking folate\\nthrough the entire pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\\nPossible lower risk of heart attack.

The  ability  to  metabolize  betacyanins  and  be  taxanthins  is  a\\ngenetic trait.

Beets,  celery,  eggplant,  lettuce,  radishes,  spinach,  and  collard  and\\n turnip greens contain nitrates that convert naturally into nitrites in your stomach—where\\n some of the nitrites combine with amines to form nitrosamines, some of which are known\\n carcinogens. This natural chemical reaction presents no known problems for a healthy adult.\\n However, when these vegetables are cooked and left standing for a while at room tempera-\\n ture, microorganisms that convert nitrates to nitrites begin to multiply, and the amount of\\n nitrites  in  the  food  rises.  The  resulting  higher-nitrite  foods  may  be  dangerous  for  infants\\n (see spinach).\\n\\n Food/Drug Interactions\\n * * *', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The one exception: In warm, humid weather, refrigerating bread slows\\n the growth of molds.\\n\\nWhen You Are Ready to Serve This Food\\nUse a serrated knife to cut bread easily.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nToasting  is  a  chemical  process  that  caramelizes  sugars  and  amino  acids  (proteins)  on  the\\nsurface  of  the  bread,  turning  the  bread  a  golden  brown.  This  chemical  reaction,  known\\nboth as the browning reaction and the Maillard reaction (after the French chemist who first\\nidentified it), alters the structure of the surface sugars, starches, and amino acids. The sugars\\nbecome  indigestible  food  fiber;  the  amino  acids  break  into  smaller  fragments  that  are  no\\nlonger nutritionally useful. Thus toast has more fiber and less protein than plain bread. How-\\never, the role of heat-generated fibers in the human diet is poorly understood. Some experts\\nconsider them inert and harmless; others believe they may be hazardous.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.      Frozen bread releases moisture that collects inside the paper, foil, or plastic bag in\\nwhich it is wrapped. If you unwrap the bread before defrosting it, the moisture will be lost\\nand the bread will be dry. Always defrost bread in its wrappings so that it can reabsorb the\\nmoisture that keeps it tasting fresh.\\nDrying.      Since molds require moisture, the less moisture a food contains, the less likely it is\\nsupport mold growth. That is why bread crumbs and Melba toast, which are relatively mois-\\nture-free, keep better than fresh bread. Both can be ground fine and used as a toasty-flavored\\nthickener in place of flour or cornstarch.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nA lower risk of some kinds of cancer.

When the green\\nchlorophyll pigments fade enough to let the yellow carotenoids underneath show through,\\nthe buds are about to bloom and the broccoli is past its prime.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nPack  broccoli  in  a  plastic  bag  and  store  it  in  the  refrigerator  or  in  the  vegetable  crisper  to\\nprotect its vitamin C. At 32°F, fresh broccoli can hold onto its vitamin C for as long as two\\nweeks.\\n        Keep broccoli out of the light; like heat, light destroys vitamin C.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nFirst, rinse the broccoli under cool running water to wash off any dirt and debris clinging to\\nthe florets. Then put the broccoli, florets down, into a pan of salt water (1 tsp. salt to 1 qt.\\nwater) and soak for 15 to 30 minutes to drive out insects hiding in the florets. Then cut off\\nthe leaves and trim away woody section of stalks. For fast cooking, divide the broccoli up\\ninto small florets and cut the stalk into thin slices.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nThe broccoli stem contains a lot of cellulose and will stay firm for a long time even through\\nthe most vigorous cooking, but the cell walls of the florets are not so strongly fortified and\\nwill soften, eventually turning to mush if you cook the broccoli long enough.\\n        Like  other  cruciferous  vegetables,  broccoli  contains  mustard  oils  (isothiocyanates),\\nnatural  chemicals  that  break  down  into  a  variety  of  smelly  sulfur  compounds  (including\\nhydrogen sulfide and ammonia) when the broccoli is heated.

One way to do this is to cook the broccoli in a large quantity of water, so the acids\\n will be diluted, but this increases the loss of vitamin C.* Another alternative is to leave the\\n lid off the pot so that the hydrogen atoms can float off into the air, but this allows the smelly\\n sulfur  compounds  to  escape,  too.  The  best  way  is  probably  to  steam  the  broccoli  quickly\\n with very little water, so it holds onto its vitamin C and cooks before there is time for reac-\\n tion between chlorophyll and hydrogen atoms to occur.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.      Frozen broccoli usually contains less vitamin C than fresh broccoli. The vitamin\\nis  lost  when  the  broccoli  is  blanched  to  inactivate  catalase  and  peroxidase,  enzymes  that\\nwould otherwise continue to ripen the broccoli in the freezer. On the other hand, according\\nto researchers at Cornell University, blanching broccoli in a microwave oven—two cups of\\nbroccoli in three tablespoons of water for three minutes at 600–700 watts—nearly doubles\\nthe amount of vitamin C retained. In experiments at Cornell, frozen broccoli blanched in a\\nmicrowave kept 90 percent of its vitamin C, compared to 56 percent for broccoli blanched in\\na pot of boiling water on top of a stove.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nProtection  against  some  cancers.           Naturally  occurring  chemicals  (indoles,  isothiocyanates,\\nglucosinolates,  dithiolethiones,  and  phenols)  in  Brussels  sprouts,  broccoli,  cabbage,  cauli-\\nflower, and other cruciferous vegetables appear to reduce the risk of some forms of cancer,\\nperhaps  by  preventing  the  formation  of  carcinogens  in  your  body  or  by  blocking  cancer-\\ncausing substances from reaching or reacting with sensitive body tissues or by inhibiting the\\ntransformation of healthy cells to malignant ones.\\n        All  cruciferous  vegetables  contain  sulforaphane,  a  member  of  a  family  of  chemicals\\nknown  as  isothiocyanates.  In  experiments  with  laboratory  rats,  sulforaphane  appears  to\\nincrease the body’s production of phase-2 enzymes, naturally occurring substances that inacti-\\nvate and help eliminate carcinogens. At the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland,\\n69 percent of the rats injected with a chemical known to cause mammary cancer developed\\ntumors vs. only 26 percent of the rats given the carcinogenic chemical plus sulforaphane.\\n        To get a protective amount of sulforaphane from broccoli you would have to eat about\\ntwo pounds a week. But in 1997, Johns Hopkins researchers discovered that broccoli seeds\\nand  three-day-old  broccoli  sprouts  contain  a  compound  converted  to  sulforaphane  when\\nthe seed and sprout cells are crushed. Five grams of three-day-old sprouts contain as much\\nsulphoraphane as 150 grams of mature broccoli.\\n\\n*    Broccoli will lose large amounts of vitamin C if you cook it in water that is cold when you start.

Up to two or every 1,000 babies born in the United States\\neach year may have cleft palate or a neural tube (spinal cord) defect due to their mothers’\\nnot having gotten adequate amounts of folate during pregnancy. The current RDA for folate\\nis  180  mcg  for  a  woman,  200  mcg  for  a  man,  but  the  FDA  now  recommends  400  mcg  for\\na  woman  who  is  or  may  become  pregnant.

One raw broccoli spear has 107 mcg folate, more than 50\\npercent of the RDA for an adult.\\nPossible lower risk of heart attack.           In the spring of 1998, an analysis of data from the records\\nfor more than 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses’ Health Study at Harvard\\nSchool of Public Health/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, demonstrated that a diet\\nproviding more than 400 mcg folate and 3 mg vitamin B 6 daily, either from food or supple-\\n ments,  might  reduce  a  woman’s  risk  of  heart  attack  by  almost  50  percent.  Although  men\\n were not included in the study, the results were assumed to apply to them as well.\\n         However,  data  from  a  meta-analysis  published  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical\\n Association in December 2006 called this theory into question. Researchers at Tulane Univer-\\n sity examined the results of 12 controlled studies in which 16,958 patients with preexisting\\n cardiovascular disease were given either folic acid supplements or placebos (“look-alike” pills\\n with no folic acid) for at least six months. The scientists, who found no reduction in the risk\\n of further heart disease or overall death rates among those taking folic acid, concluded that\\n further studies will be required to ascertain whether taking folic acid supplements reduces\\n the risk of cardiovascular disease.\\n Possible  inhibition  of  the  herpes  virus.

One way to do this is to cook the sprouts in a lot of water, so the acids\\n will be diluted, but this increases the loss of vitamin C.* Another alternative is to leave the\\n lid off the pot so that the hydrogen atoms can float off into the air, but this allows the smelly\\n sulfur compounds to escape, too.

Frozen brussels sprouts contain virtually the same amounts of vitamins as fresh\\n boiled sprouts.\\n\\n Medical Uses and/or Benefits\\n Protection  against  cancer.        Naturally  occurring  chemicals  (indoles,  isothiocyanates,  gluco-\\n sinolates,  dithiolethiones,  and  phenols)  in  brussels  sprouts,  broccoli,  cabbage,  cauliflower\\n and other cruciferous vegetables appear to reduce the risk of some cancers, perhaps by pre-\\n venting the formation of carcinogens in your body or by blocking cancer-causing substances\\n from reaching or reacting with sensitive body tissues or by inhibiting the transformation of\\n healthy cells to malignant ones.\\n        All  cruciferous  vegetables  contain  sulforaphane,  a  member  of  a  family  of  chemicals\\n known  as  isothiocyanates.  In  experiments  with  laboratory  rats,  sulforaphane  appears  to\\n increase the body’s production of phase-2 enzymes, naturally occurring substances that inac-\\n tivate and help eliminate carcinogens. At Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland,\\n 69 percent of the rats injected with a chemical known to cause mammary cancer developed\\n tumors vs. only 26 percent of the rats given the carcinogenic chemical plus sulforaphane.\\n        In  1997,  the  Johns  Hopkins  researchers  discovered  that  broccoli  seeds  and  three-\\n day-old  broccoli  sprouts  contain  a  compound  converted  to  sulforaphane  when  the  seed\\n and sprout cells are crushed. Five grams of three-day-old broccoli sprouts contain as much\\n sulforaphane as 150 grams of mature broccoli.

Even refrigerated butter will eventually turn rancid as its\\n   fat molecules combine with oxygen to produce hydroperoxides that, in turn, break down into\\n   chemicals with an unpleasant flavor and aroma. This reaction is slowed (but not stopped)\\n   by cold. Because salt retards the combination of fats with oxygen, salted butter stays fresh\\n   longer than plain butter. (Lard, which is pork fat, must also be refrigerated. Lard has a higher\\n   proportion of unsaturated fats than the butter.

They keep foods from sticking to the pot or pan; add fla-\\n   vor; and, as they warm, transfer heat from the pan to the food.

The leaves should be tightly closed and\\nattached tightly at the stem end. The outer leaves on a savoy cabbage may curl back from the\\nhead, but the center leaves should still be relatively tightly closed.\\n        Also look for green cabbages that still have their dark-green, vitamin-rich outer leaves.\\nAvoid:     Green  and  savoy  cabbage  with  yellow  or  wilted  leaves.  The  yellow  carotene  pig-\\nments  show  through  only  when  the  cabbage  has  aged  and  its  green  chlorophyll  pigments\\nhave faded. Wilted leaves mean a loss of moisture and vitamins.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nHandle cabbage gently; bruising tears cells and activates ascorbic acid oxidase, an enzyme in\\nthe leaves that hastens the destruction of vitamin C.\\n        Store cabbage in a cool, dark place, preferably a refrigerator. In cold storage, cabbage\\ncan retain as much as 75 percent of its vitamin C for as long as six months. Cover the cabbage\\nto keep it from drying out and losing vitamin A.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nDo not slice the cabbage until you are ready to use it; slicing tears cabbage cells and releases\\nthe enzyme that hastens the oxidation and destruction of vitamin C.\\n        If you plan to serve cooked green or red cabbage in wedges, don’t cut out the inner core\\nthat hold the leaves together.\\n        To separate the leaves for stuffing, immerse the entire head in boiling water for a few\\nminutes, then lift it out and let it drain until it is cool enough to handle comfortably.

The longer you cook the cabbage,\\nthe  more  smelly  the  compounds  will  be.  Adding  a  slice  of  bread  to  the  cooking  water\\nmay lessen the odor. Keeping a lid on the pot will stop the smelly molecules from floating\\noff into the air, but it will also accelerate the chemical reaction that turns cooked green\\ncabbage drab.\\n        Chlorophyll,  the  pigment  that  makes  green  vegetables  green,  is  sensitive  to  acids.\\nWhen you heat green cabbage, the chlorophyll in its leaves reacts chemically with acids in\\nthe cabbage or in the cooking water to form pheophytin, which is brown. The pheophytin\\ngives the cooked cabbage its olive color.\\n        To keep cooked green cabbage green, you have to reduce the interaction between the\\nchlorophyll  and  the  acids.  One  way  to  do  this  is  to  cook  the  cabbage  in  a  large  quantity\\nof  water,  so  the  acids  will  be  diluted,  but  this  increases  the  loss  of  vitamin  C.*  Another\\n alternative is to leave the lid off the pot so that the volatile acids can float off into the air,\\n but this allows the smelly sulfur compounds to escape too. The best way may be to steam\\n the cabbage very quickly in very little water so that it keeps its vitamin C and cooks before\\n there is time for the chlorophyll/acid reaction to occur.\\n        Red  cabbage  is  colored  with  red  anthocyanins,  pigments  that  turn  redder  in  acids\\n (lemon juice, vinegar) and blue purple in bases (alkaline chemicals such as baking soda). To\\n keep the cabbage red, make sweet-and-sour cabbage. But be careful not to make it in an iron\\n or  aluminum  pot,  since  vinegar  (which  contains  tannins)  will  react  with  these  metals  to\\n create dark pigments that discolor both the pot and the vegetable. Glass, stainless-steel, or\\n enameled pots do not produce this reaction.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nPickling.     Sauerkraut is a fermented and pickled produce made by immersing cabbage in a\\nsalt solution strong enough to kill off pathological bacteria but allow beneficial ones to sur-\\nvive, breaking down proteins in the cabbage and producing the acid that gives sauerkraut its\\ndistinctive flavor. Sauerkraut contains more than 37 times as much sodium as fresh cabbage\\n(661 mg sodium/100 grams canned sauerkraut with liquid) but only one third the vitamin C\\nand one-seventh the vitamin A.\\n\\n*    According  to  USDA,  if  you  cook  three  cups  of  cabbage  in  one  cup  of  water  you  will  lose  only  10\\n    percent of the vitamin C; reverse the ratio to four times as much water as cabbage and you will lose\\n    about 50 percent of the vitamin C. Cabbage will lose as much as 25 percent of its vitamin C if you\\n    cook it in water that is cold when you start. As it boils, water releases oxygen that would otherwise\\n    destroy vitamin C, so you can cut the vitamin loss dramatically simply by letting the water boil for\\n    60 seconds before adding the cabbage.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Naturally  occurring  chemicals  (indoles,  isothiocyanates,\\n glucosinolates,  dithiolethiones,  and  phenols)  in  cabbage,  brussels  sprouts,  broccoli,  cauli-\\n flower, and other cruciferous vegetables appear to reduce the risk of some cancers, perhaps\\n by  preventing  the  formation  of  carcinogens  in  your  body  or  by  blocking  cancer-causing\\n substances from reaching or reacting with sensitive body tissues or by inhibiting the trans-\\n formation of healthy cells to malignant ones.\\n        All  cruciferous  vegetables  contain  sulforaphane,  a  member  of  a  family  of  chemicals\\n known  as  isothiocyanates.  In  experiments  with  laboratory  rats,  sulforaphane  appears  to\\n increase the body’s production of phase-2 enzymes, naturally occurring substances that inac-\\n tivate and help eliminate carcinogens. At Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland,\\n 69 percent of the rats injected with a chemical known to cause mammary cancer developed\\n tumors vs. only 26 percent of the rats given the carcinogenic chemical plus sulforaphane.\\n        In  1997,  Johns  Hopkins  researchers  discovered  that  broccoli  seeds  and  three-day-old\\n broccoli sprouts contain a compound converted to sulforaphane when the seed and sprout\\n cells are crushed. Five grams of three-day-old broccoli sprouts contain as much sulforaphane\\n as 150 grams of mature broccoli. The sulforaphane levels in other cruciferous vegetables have\\n not yet been calculated.\\n Vision protection.       In 2004, the Johns Hopkins researchers updated their findings on sulfora-\\n phane  to  suggest  that  it  may  also  protect  cells  in  the  eyes  from  damage  due  to  ultraviolet\\n light, thus reducing the risk of macular degeneration, the most common cause of age-related\\n vision loss.\\n Lower risk of some birth defects.           As many as two of every 1,000 babies born in the United\\n States each year may have cleft palate or a neural tube (spinal cord) defect due to their moth-\\n ers’ not having gotten adequate amounts of folate during pregnancy. The current RDA for\\n folate is 180 mcg for a woman and 200 mcg for a man, but the FDA now recommends 400\\n mcg for a woman who is or may become pregnant. Taking a folate supplement before becom-\\n ing pregnant and through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the risk of cleft palate;\\n taking folate through the entire pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\\n Possible lower risk of heart attack.          In the spring of 1998, an analysis of data from the records\\nfor more than 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses’ Health Study at Harvard\\nSchool of Public Health/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, demonstrated that a diet\\nproviding more than 400 mcg folate and 3 mg vitamin B 6 daily, either from food or supple-\\n ments,  might  reduce  a  woman’s  risk  of  heart  attack  by  almost  50  percent.  Although  men\\n were not included in the study, the results were assumed to apply to them as well.\\n        However,  data  from  a  meta-analysis  published  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical\\n Association in December 2006 called this theory into question. Researchers at Tulane Univer-\\n sity examined the results of 12 controlled studies in which 16,958 patients with preexisting\\n cardiovascular disease were given either folic acid supplements or placebos (“look-alike” pills', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, contain goitrin,\\nthiocyanate, and isothiocyanate. These chemicals, known collectively as goitrogens, inhibit\\nthe formation of thyroid hormones and cause the thyroid to enlarge in an attempt to pro-\\nduce more. Goitrogens are not hazardous for healthy people who eat moderate amounts of\\ncruciferous vegetables, but they may pose problems for people who have a thyroid condition\\nor are taking thyroid medication.\\nIntestinal gas.      Bacteria that live naturally in the gut degrade the indigestible carbohydrates\\n(food fiber) in cabbage, producing gas that some people find distressing.\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\nAnticoagulants        Cabbage  contains  vitamin  K,  the  blood-clotting  vitamin  produced  natu-\\nrally by bacteria in the intestines. Consuming large quantities of this food may reduce the\\neffectiveness of anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin (Coumadin).

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are drugs used to treat\\ndepression. They inactivate naturally occurring enzymes in your body that metabolize tyra-\\nmine, a substance found in many fermented or aged foods. Tyramine constricts blood vessels\\nand increases blood pressure.

The leafy tops will wilt and rot long before\\nthe sturdy root.\\n        Keep carrots cool. They will actually gain vitamin A during their first five months in\\nstorage. Protected from heat and light, they can hold to their vitamins at least another two\\nand a half months.\\n        Store carrots in perforated plastic bags or containers. Circulating air prevents the for-\\nmation of the terpenoids that make the carrots taste bitter.

According to the American Cancer Society, carrots\\nand other foods rich in beta-carotene, a deep yellow pigment that your body converts to a\\nform of vitamin A, may lower the risk of cancers of the larynx, esophagus and lungs. There\\nis no such benefit from beta-carotene supplements; indeed, one controversial study actually\\nshowed a higher rate of lung cancer among smokers taking the supplement.\\nProtection  against  vitamin  A-deficiency  blindness.            In  the  body,  the  vitamin  A  from  carrots\\nbecomes 11-cis retinol, the essential element in rhodopsin, a protein found in the rods (the\\ncells inside your eyes that let you see in dim light). Rhodopsin absorbs light, triggering the\\nchain  of  chemical  reactions  known  as  vision.  One  raw  carrot  a  day  provides  more  than\\nenough vitamin A to maintain vision in a normal healthy adult.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nOddly pigmented skin.           The carotenoids in carrots are fat-soluble. If you eat large amounts\\nof carrots day after day, these carotenoids will be stored in your fatty tissues, including the\\nfat just under your skin, and eventually your skin will look yellow. If you eat large amounts\\nof  carrots  and  large  amounts  of  tomatoes  (which  contain  the  red  pigment  lycopene),  your\\nskin may be tinted orange. This effect has been seen in people who ate two cups of carrots\\nand two tomatoes a day for several months; when the excessive amounts of these vegetables\\nwere eliminated from the diet, skin color returned to normal.\\nFalse-positive test for occult blood in the stool.

To keep the cauliflower crisp when cooked, add a\\nteaspoon of vinegar to the water. You can steam or bake the cauliflower head whole or break\\nit up into florets for faster cooking.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nCauliflower contains mustard oils (isothiocyanates), natural chemicals that give the vegeta-\\nble its taste but break down into a variety of smelly sulfur compounds (including hydrogen\\nsulfide and ammonia) when the cauliflower is heated. The longer you cook the cauliflower,\\nthe  better  it  will  taste  but  the  worse  it  will  smell.  Adding  a  slice  of  bread  to  the  cooking\\nwater  may  lessen  the  odor;  keeping  a  lid  on  the  pot  will  stop  the  smelly  molecules  from\\nfloating off into the air.\\n        Cooking cauliflower in an aluminum pot will intensify its odor and turn its creamy\\nwhite  anthoxanthin  pigments  yellow;  iron  pots  will  turn  anthoxanthins  blue  green  or\\nbrown. Like red and blue anthocyanin pigments (see beets , blackberries , blueberries), antho-\\nxanthins hold their color best in acids. To keep cauliflower white, add a tablespoon of lemon\\njuice, lime juice, vinegar, or milk to the cooking water.\\n        Steaming or stir-frying cauliflower preserves the vitamin C that would be lost if the\\nvegetable were cooked for a long time or in a lot of water.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.     Before it is frozen, cauliflower must be blanched to inactivate catalase and per-\\noxidase,  enzymes  that  would  otherwise  continue  to  ripen  and  eventually  deteriorate  the\\nvegetable. According to researchers at Cornell University, cauliflower will lose less vitamin C\\nif it is blanched in very little water (two cups cauliflower in two tbsp. water) in a microwave-\\nsafe plastic bag in a microwave oven for four minutes at 600–700 watts. Leave the bag open\\nan inch at the top so steam can escape and the bag does not explode.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nProtection  against  certain  cancers.        Naturally  occurring  chemicals  (indoles,  isothiocyanates,\\nglucosinolates, dithiolethiones, and phenols) in cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cab-\\nbage,  and  other  cruciferous  vegetables  appear  to  reduce  the  risk  of  some  cancers,  perhaps', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In  2004,  the  Johns  Hopkins  researchers  updated  their  findings  on  sul-\\nforaphane  to  suggest  that  it  may  also  protect  cells  in  the  eyes  from  damage  due  to  UV\\n(ultraviolet) light, thus reducing the risk of macular degeneration, the most common cause\\nof age-related vision loss.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nEnlarged  thyroid  gland  (goiter).         Cruciferous  vegetables,  including  cauliflower,  contain  goi-\\ntrin,  thiocyanate,  and  isothiocyanate.

All of these\\nchanges  may  force  moisture  out  of  the  protein  tissue,  which  is  why  overcooked  cheese  is\\noften  stringy.  Whey  proteins,  which  do  not  clump  or  string  at  low  temperatures,  contain\\nthe sulfur atoms that give hot or burned cheese an unpleasant “cooked” odor. To avoid both\\nstrings and an unpleasant odor, add cheese to sauces at the last minute and cook just long\\nenough to melt the cheese.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.      All cheese loses moisture when frozen, so semisoft cheeses will freeze and thaw\\nbetter than hard cheeses, which may be crumbly when defrosted.\\nDrying.      The less moisture cheese contains, the less able it is to support the growth of organ-\\nisms like mold. Dried cheeses keep significantly longer than ordinary cheeses.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nTo  strengthen  bones  and  reduce  age-related  loss  of  bone  density.            High-calcium  foods  protect\\nbone density. The current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium is still 800 mg\\nfor adults 25 and older, but a 1984 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Conference advisory\\nstated that lifelong protection for bones requires an RDA of 1,000 mg for healthy men and\\nwomen age 25 to 50; 1,000 mg for older women using hormone replacement therapy; and\\n1,500 mg for older women who are not using hormones, and these recommendations have\\nbeen confirmed in a 1994 NIH Consensus Statement on optimal calcium intake. A diet with\\nadequate  amounts  of  calcium-rich  foods  helps  protect  bone  density.  Low-fat  and  no-fat\\ncheeses provide calcium without excess fat and cholesterol.\\nProtection against tooth decay.          Studies at the University of Iowa (Iowa City) Dental School\\nconfirm  that  a  wide  variety  of  cheeses,  including  aged  cheddar,  Edam,  Gouda,  Monterey\\nJack, Muenster, mozzarella, Port Salut, Roquefort, Romano, Stilton, Swiss, and Tilsit—limit\\nthe tooth decay ordinarily expected when sugar becomes trapped in plaque, the sticky film\\non tooth surfaces where cavity-causing bacteria flourish.

Like other foods from animals, cheese is a source of choles-\\nterol and saturated fats, which increase the amount of cholesterol circulating in your blood\\nand raise your risk of heart disease. To reduce the risk of heart disease, the USDA/Health\\nand Human Services Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting the amount of\\ncholesterol in your diet to no more than 300 mg a day. The guidelines also recommend limit-\\ning the amount of fat you consume to no more than 30 percent of your total calories, while\\nholding your consumption of saturated fats to more than 10 percent of your total calories (the\\ncalories from saturated fats are counted as part of the total calories from fat).\\nFood  poisoning.        Cheese  made  from  raw  (unpasteurized)  milk  may  contain  hazardous\\nmicroorganisms, including Salmonella and Listeria. Salmonella causes serious gastric upset; Lis-\\nteria, a flulike infection, encephalitis, or blood infection. Both may be life-threatening to the\\nvery young, the very old, pregnant women, and those whose immune systems are weakened\\neither by illness (such as AIDS) or drugs (such as cancer chemotherapy). In 1998, the Federal\\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC) released data identifying Listeria as the cause of nearly\\nhalf the reported deaths from food poisoning.\\nAllergy to milk proteins.         Milk is one of the foods most frequently implicated as a cause of\\nallergic reactions, particularly upset stomach. However, in many cases the reaction is not a\\ntrue allergy but the result of lactose intolerance (see below).\\nLactose  intolerance.       Lactose  intolerance—the  inability  to  digest  the  sugar  in  milk—is  an\\ninherited metabolic deficiency that affects two thirds of all adults, including 90 to 95 percent\\nof all Orientals, 70 to 75 percent of all blacks, and 6 to 8 percent of Caucasians. These people\\ndo not have sufficient amounts of lactase, the enzyme that breaks the disaccharide lactose\\ninto its easily digested components, galactose and glucose. When they drink milk, the undi-\\ngested sugar is fermented by bacteria in the gut, causing bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and\\nintestinal discomfort. Some milk is now sold with added lactase to digest the lactose and\\nmake the milk usable for lactase-deficient people. In making cheese, most of the lactose in\\nmilk is broken down into glucose and galactose. There is very little lactose in cheeses other\\nthan the fresh ones—cottage cheese, cream cheese, and farmer cheese.\\nGalactosemia.        Galactosemia is an inherited metabolic disorder in which the body lacks the\\nenzymes needed to metabolize galactose, a component of lactose. Galactosemia is a reces-\\nsive trait; you must receive the gene from both parents to develop the condition. Babies born\\nwith galactosemia will fail to thrive and may develop brain damage or cataracts if they are\\ngiven milk. To prevent this, children with galactosemia are usually kept on a protective milk-\\nfree diet for several years, until their bodies have developed alternative pathways by which', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In\\n2004, scientists at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center in Davis, California, released\\ndata from a study showing that women who ate 45 bing (sweet) cherries at breakfast each\\nmorning had markedly lower blood levels of uric acid, a by-product of protein metabolism\\nlinked to pain and inflammation, during an acute episode of gout (a form of arthritis). The\\nwomen in the study also had lower blood levels of C-reactive protein and nitric acid, two\\nother chemicals linked to inflammation. These effects are yet to be proven in larger studies\\nwith a more diverse group of subjects.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n* * *\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\n* * *', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Second, it melts at 95°F, the temperature of the\\n     human tongue. Cocoa butter has no cholesterol; neither does plain cocoa\\n     powder or plain dark chocolate.\\n            Cocoa beans have B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin) plus min-\\n^    erals (iron, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and copper).

When  you  open  a  box  of  chocolates  or  unwrap  a\\n   candy bar, the chocolate should be glossy and shiny. Chocolate that looks dull may be stale,\\n   or it may be inexpensively made candy without enough cocoa butter to make it gleam and\\n   give it the rich creamy mouthfeel we associate with the best chocolate. (Fine chocolate melts\\n   evenly on the tongue.) Chocolate should also smell fresh, not dry and powdery, and when\\n   you break a bar or piece of chocolate it should break cleanly, not crumble. One exception: If\\n   you have stored a bar of chocolate in the refrigerator, it may splinter if you break it without\\n   bringing it to room temperature first.\\n\\n   Storing This Food\\n   Store  chocolate  at  a  constant  temperature,  preferably  below  78°F.  At  higher  temperatures,\\n   the fat in the chocolate will rise to the surface and, when the chocolate is cooled, the fat will\\n   solidify into a whitish powdery bloom. Bloom is unsightly but doesn’t change the chocolate’s\\n   taste or nutritional value. To get rid of bloom, melt the chocolate. The chocolate will turn\\n   dark, rich brown again when its fat recombines with the other ingredients. Chocolate with\\n   bloom makes a perfectly satisfactory chocolate sauce.\\n           Dark  chocolate  (bitter  chocolate,  semisweet  chocolate)  ages  for  at  least  six  months\\n   after it is made, as its flavor becomes deeper and more intense. Wrapped tightly and stored in\\n   a cool, dry cabinet, it can stay fresh for a year or more. Milk chocolate ages only for about a\\n   month after it is made and holds its peak flavor for about three to six months, depending on\\n   how carefully it is stored. Plain cocoa, with no added milk powder or sugar, will stay fresh\\n   for up to a year if you keep it tightly sealed and cool.\\n\\n   Preparing This Food\\n   * * *\\n\\n   What Happens When You Cook This Food\\n   Chocolate burns easily. To melt it without mishap, stir the chocolate in a bowl over a pot of\\n   hot water or in the top of a double boiler or put the chocolate in a covered dish and melt it in\\n   the microwave (which does not get as hot as a pot on the store).\\n           Simple  chemistry  dictates  that  chocolate  cakes  be  leavened  with  baking  soda  rather\\n   than  baking  powder.  Chocolate  is  so  acidic  that  it  will  upset  the  delicate  balance  of  acid\\n   (cream of tartar) and base (alkali = sodium bicarbonate = baking soda) in baking powder.\\n   But it is not acidic enough to balance plain sodium bicarbonate. That’s why we add an acidic\\n   sour-milk product such as buttermilk or sour cream or yogurt to a chocolate cake.

Chocolate  freezes  and  thaws  well.  Pack  it  in  a  moistureproof  container  and\\ndefrost it in the same package to let it reabsorb moisture it gave off while frozen.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nMood elevator.        Chocolate’s reputation for making people feel good is based not only on its\\ncaffeine content—19 mg caffeine per ounce of dark (sweet) chocolate, which is one-third the\\namount of caffeine in a five-ounce cup of brewed coffee—but also on its naturally occurring\\nmood altering chemicals phenylethylalanine and anandamide. Phenylethylalanine is found\\nin the blood of people in love. Anandamide stimulates areas of your brain also affected by\\nthe  active  ingredients  in  marijuana.  (NOTE:  As  noted  by  the  researchers  at  the  Neurosci-\\nences  Institute  in  San  Diego  who  identified  anandamide  in  chocolate  in  1996,  to  get  even\\nthe faintest hint of marijuana-like effects from chocolate you would have to eat more than\\n25 pounds of the candy all at once.)\\nPossible heart health benefits.          Chocolate is rich in catechins, the antioxidant chemicals that\\ngive tea its reputation as a heart-protective anticancer beverage (see tea). In addition, a series\\nof studies beginning with those at the USDA Agricultural Research Center in Peoria, Illinois,\\nsuggest that consuming foods rich in stearic acid like chocolate may reduce rather than raise\\nthe risk of a blood clot leading to a heart attack.\\nPossible  slowing  of  the  aging  process.          Chocolate  is  a  relatively  good  source  of  copper,  a\\nmineral  that  may  play  a  role  in  slowing  the  aging  process  by  decreasing  the  incidence  of\\n“protein glycation,” a reaction in which sugar molecules (gly = sugar) hook up with protein\\nmolecules  in  the  bloodstream,  twisting  the  protein  molecules  out  of  shape  and  rendering\\nthem unusable.  This  can lead to bone loss, rising cholesterol, cardiac abnormalities,  and  a\\nslew of other unpleasantries. In people with diabetes, excess protein glycation may be one\\nfactor involved in complications such as loss of vision. Ordinarily, increased protein glyca-\\ntion is age-related. But at the USDA Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center in North\\nDakota, agricultural research scientist Jack T. Saari has found that rats on copper-deficient\\ndiets experience more protein glycation at any age than other rats. A recent USDA survey of\\nAmerican eating patterns says that most of us get about 1.2 mg copper a day, considerably\\nless than the Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intake (ESADDI) or 1.5 mg to 3\\nmg a day. Vegetarians are less likely to be copper deficient because, as Saari notes, the foods\\nhighest in copper are whole grains, nuts, seeds, and beans, including the cocoa bean. One\\nounce of dark chocolate has .25 mg copper (8–17 percent of the ESADDI).\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nPossible loss of bone density.

Tyramine constricts blood vessels\\n   and increases blood pressure. Caffeine is a substance similar to tyramine.

When coffee is exposed to air, the\\nvolatile  molecules  that  give  it  its  distinctive  flavor  and  richness  escape,  leaving  the  coffee\\nflavorless and/or bitter.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nStore  unopened  vacuum-packed  cans  of  ground  coffee  or  coffee  beans  in  a  cool,  dark\\ncabinet—where they will stay fresh for six months to a year. They will lose some flavor\\nin  storage,  though,  because  it  is  impossible  to  can  coffee  without  trapping  some  flavor-\\ndestroying air inside the can.\\n        Once the can or paper sack has been opened, the coffee or beans should be sealed as\\ntight as possible and stored in the refrigerator. Tightly wrapped, refrigerated ground coffee\\nwill hold its freshness and flavor for about a week, whole beans for about three weeks.

Both lack oxygen,\\nwhich means that your coffee will taste flat.\\n        Always brew coffee in a scrupulously clean pot. Each time you make coffee, oils are\\nleft on the inside of the pot. If you don’t scrub them off, they will turn rancid and the next\\npot of coffee you brew will taste bitter. To clean a coffee pot, wash it with detergent, rinse\\nit with water in which you have dissolved a few teaspoons of baking soda, then rinse one\\nmore time with boiling water.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nIn  making  coffee,  your  aim  is  to  extract  flavorful  solids  (including  coffee  oils  and  sucrose\\nand  other  sugars)  from  the  ground  beans  without  pulling  bitter,  astringent  tannins  along\\nwith them. How long you brew the coffee determines how much solid material you extract\\nand  how  the  coffee  tastes.  The  longer  the  brewing  time,  the  greater  the  amount  of  solids\\nextracted. If you brew the coffee long enough to extract more than 30 percent of its solids,\\nyou will get bitter compounds along with the flavorful ones. (These will also develop by let-\\nting coffee sit for a long time after brewing it.)\\n        Ordinarily, drip coffee tastes less bitter than percolator coffee because the water in a\\ndrip coffeemaker goes through the coffee only once, while the water in the percolator pot\\nis circulated through the coffee several times. To make strong but not bitter coffee, increase\\nthe amount of coffee—not the brewing time.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nDrying.      Soluble  coffees  (freeze-dried,  instant)  are  made  by  dehydrating  concentrated\\nbrewed coffee. These coffees are often lower in caffeine than regular ground coffees because\\ncaffeine, which dissolves in water, is lost when the coffee is dehydrated.\\nDecaffeinating.       Decaffeinated coffee is made with beans from which the caffeine has been\\nextracted, either with an organic solvent (methylene chloride) or with water. How the coffee\\nis  decaffeinated  has  no  effect  on  its  taste,  but  many  people  prefer  water-processed  decaf-\\nfeinated coffee because it is not a chemically treated food. (Methylene chloride is an animal\\ncarcinogen, but the amounts that remain in coffees decaffeinated with methylene chloride\\nare so small that the FDA does not consider them hazardous. The carcinogenic organic sol-\\nvent trichloroethylene [TCE], a chemical that causes liver cancer in laboratory animals, is no\\nlonger used to decaffeinate coffee.)\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nAs a stimulant and mood elevator.

Adenosine is a regular chemical that keeps nerve cell activ-\\nity within safe limits. When caffeine molecules hook up to sites in the brain when adenosine\\nmolecules normally dock, nerve cells continue to fire indiscriminately, producing the jangly\\nfeeling sometimes associated with drinking coffee, tea, and other caffeine products.\\n        As a rule, it takes five to six hours to metabolize and excrete caffeine from the body.\\nDuring that time, its effects may vary widely from person to person. Some find its stimu-\\nlation  pleasant,  even  relaxing;  others  experience  restlessness,  nervousness,  hyperactivity,\\ninsomnia, flushing, and upset stomach after as little as one cup a day. It is possible to develop\\na tolerance for caffeine, so people who drink coffee every day are likely to find it less imme-\\ndiately stimulating than those who drink it only once in a while.\\nChanges in blood vessels.         Caffeine’s effects on blood vessels depend on site: It dilates coronary\\nand gastrointestinal vessels but constricts blood vessels in your head and may relieve headache,\\nsuch as migraine, which symptoms include swollen cranial blood vessels. It may also increase\\npain-free exercise time in patients with angina. However, because it speeds up heartbeat, doc-\\ntors often advise patients with heart disease to avoid caffeinated beverages entirely.\\nAs a diuretic.      Caffeine is a mild diuretic sometimes included in over-the-counter remedies\\nfor premenstrual tension or menstrual discomfort.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nStimulation of acid secretion in the stomach.            Both regular and decaffeinated coffees increase the\\nsecretion of stomach acid, which suggests that the culprit is the oil in coffee, not its caffeine.\\nElevated blood levels of cholesterol and homocysteine.                 In the mid-1990s, several studies in the\\nNetherlands  and  Norway  suggested  that  drinking  even  moderate  amounts  of  coffee  (five\\ncups a day or less) might raise blood levels of cholesterol and homocysteine (by-product of\\nprotein  metabolism  considered  an  independent  risk  factor  for  heart  disease),  thus  increas-\\ning the risk of cardiovascular disease. Follow-up studies, however, showed the risk limited\\nto drinking unfiltered coffees such as coffee made in a coffee press, or boiled coffees such\\nas  Greek,  Turkish,  or  espresso  coffee.  The  unfiltered  coffees  contain  problematic  amounts\\nof  cafestol  and  kahweol,  two  members  of  a  chemical  family  called  diterpenes,  which  are\\nbelieved to affect cholesterol and homocysteine levels. Diterpenes are removed by filtering\\ncoffee, as in a drip-brew pot.\\nPossible  increased  risk  of  miscarriage.           Two  studies  released  in  2008  arrived  at  different\\nconclusions regarding a link between coffee consumption and an increased risk of miscar-\\nriage. The first, at Kaiser Permanente (California), found a higher risk of miscarriage among\\nwomen  consuming  even  two  eight-ounce  cups  of  coffee  a  day.  The  second,  at  Mt.  Sinai\\nSchool of Medicine (New York), found no such link. However, although the authors of the\\nKaiser Permanente study described it as a “prospective study” (a study in which the research-\\ners report results that occur after the study begins), in fact nearly two-thirds of the women\\nwho suffered a miscarriage miscarried before the study began, thus confusing the results.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The  natural  oils  in  both  regular  and  decaffeinated\\ncoffees loosen the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a muscular valve between the esopha-\\ngus and the stomach. When food is swallowed, the valve opens to let food into the stomach,\\nthen closes tightly to keep acidic stomach contents from refluxing (flowing backwards) into\\nthe esophagus. If the LES does not close efficiently, the stomach contents reflux and cause\\nheartburn, a burning sensation. Repeated reflux is a risk factor for esophageal cancer.\\nMasking of sleep disorders.            Sleep deprivation is a serious problem associated not only with\\nautomobile accidents but also with health conditions such as depression and high blood pres-\\nsure.

Some  medical  drugs  slow  the  body’s\\nmetabolism of caffeine, thus increasing its stimulating effect.

If  you  are\\ntaking one of these medicines, check with your doctor regarding your consumption of caf-\\nfeinated beverages.\\nDrugs whose adverse effects increase due to consumption of large amounts of caffeine.\\nThis  list  includes  such  drugs  as  metaproterenol  (Alupent),  clozapine  (Clozaril),  ephedrine,\\nepinephrine,  monoamine  oxidase  inhibitors,  phenylpropanolamine,  and  theophylline.  In\\naddition, suddenly decreasing your caffeine intake may increase blood levels of lithium, a\\ndrug used to control mood swings. If you are taking one of these medicines, check with your\\ndoctor regarding your consumption of caffeinated beverages.\\nAllopurinol.       Coffee  and  other  beverages  containing  methylxanthine  stimulants  (caffeine,\\ntheophylline,  and  theobromine)  reduce  the  effectiveness  of  the  antigout  drug  allopurinol,\\nwhich is designed to inhibit xanthines.\\nAnalgesics.       Caffeine strengthens over-the-counter painkillers (acetaminophen, aspirin, and\\nother  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatories  [NSAIDS]  such  as  ibuprofen  and  naproxen).  But  it\\nalso makes it more likely that NSAIDS will irritate your stomach lining.\\nAntibiotics.

Corn  is  a  moderately  good  source  of  plant  proteins,  but  zein  (its\\n     major  protein)  is  deficient  in  the  essential  amino  acids  lysine,  cystine,\\n     and tryptophan.

Keeping  corn  cool  helps\\nretain its vitamin C and slows the natural conversion of the corn’s sugars to starch.\\n        Choose fresh corn with medium-sized kernels that yield slightly when you press them\\nwith your fingertip. Very small kernels are immature; very large ones are older and will taste\\nstarchy rather than sweet. Both yellow and white kernels may be equally tasty, but the husk\\nof  the  corn  should  always  be  moist  and  green.  A  dry  yellowish  husk  means  that  the  corn\\nis old enough for the chlorophyll pigments in the husk to have faded, letting the carotenes\\nunderneath show through.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nRefrigerate fresh corn. At room temperature, fresh-picked sweet corn will convert nearly half\\nits sugar to starch within 24 hours and lose half its vitamin C in four days. In the refrigera-\\ntor, it may keep all its vitamin C for up to a week and may retain its sweet taste for as long\\nas ten days.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nStrip  off  the  husks  and  silk,  and  brush  with  a  vegetable  brush  to  get  rid  of  clinging  silky\\nthreads. Rinse the corn briefly under running water, and plunge into boiling water for four\\nto six minutes, depending on the size of the corn.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nHeat denatures (breaks apart) the long-chain protein molecules in the liquid inside the corn\\nkernel, allowing them to form a network of protein molecules that will squeeze out moisture\\nand turn rubbery if you cook the corn too long. Heat also allows the starch granules inside\\nthe kernel to absorb water so that they swell and eventually rupture, releasing the nutrients\\ninside.

Canned corn and frozen corn both have less vitamin C than fresh-\\ncooked corn. The vitamin is lost when the corn is heated during canning or blanched before\\nfreezing to destroy the natural enzymes that would otherwise continue to ripen it. Blanch-\\ning in a microwave oven rather than in boiling water can preserve the vitamin C in frozen\\ncorn (see above).\\nMilling.     Milling  removes  the  hull  and  germ  from  the  corn  kernel,  leaving  what  is  called\\nhominy. Hominy, which is sometimes soaked in wood ash (lye) to increase its calcium con-\\ntent, can be dried and used as a cereal (grits) or ground into corn flour. Coarsely ground corn\\nflour is called cornmeal.\\nProcessed corn cereals.        All processed, ready-to-eat corn cereals are much higher in sodium\\nand sugar than fresh corn.\\nAdded  calcium  carbonate.          Pellagra  is  a  niacin-deficiency  disease  that  occurs  most  com-\\nmonly among people for whom corn is the staple food in a diet lacking protein foods with\\nthe essential amino acid tryptophan, which can be converted to niacin in the human body.\\nPellagra is not an inevitable result of a diet high in corn, however, since the niacin in corn\\ncan be made more useful by soaking the corn in a solution of calcium carbonate (lime) and\\nwater. In Mexico, for example, the corn used to make tortillas is boiled in a dilute solution of\\ncalcium carbonate (from shells or limestone) and water, then washed, drained, and ground.\\nThe alkaline bath appears to release the bound niacin in corn so that it can be absorbed by\\nthe body.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nAs a wheat substitute in baking.           People who are allergic to wheat or cannot tolerate the glu-\\nten in wheat flour or wheat cereals can often use corn flour or hominy instead.\\nBath powder.       Corn starch, a fine powder refined from the endosperm (inner part) of the corn\\nkernel, can be used as an inexpensive, unperfumed body or face powder.

You can make a soft cucumber crisp again by slic-\\ning it and soaking the slices in salted water.

Check to see if the cucumber has been waxed\\nby scraping the skin gently with the tip of your fingernail and then looking for waxy resi-\\ndue under the nail. If the skin is waxed, you can peel it off—but not until you are ready to\\nuse it, since slicing the cucumber tears its cell walls, releasing an enzyme that oxidizes and\\ndestroys vitamin C.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\n* * *\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nPickling.

By law, vodkas made\\nin America must be made with spirits distilled from grains. Imported vodkas may be made\\nwith  spirits  distilled  either  from  grains  or  potatoes  and  may  contain  additional  flavoring\\nagents such as citric acid or pepper. Aquavit, for example, is essentially vodka flavored with\\ncaraway  seeds.  Gin  is  a  clear  spirit  flavored  with  an  infusion  of  juniper  berries  and  other\\nherbs (botanicals). Cordials (also called liqueurs) and schnapps are flavored spirits; most are\\nsweetened with added sugar. Some cordials contain cream.\\nRum      is made with spirits distilled from sugar cane (molasses). Tequila is made with spirits\\ndistilled from the blue agave plant. Brandies are made with spirits distilled from fruit. (Arma-\\ngnac and cognac are distilled from fermented grapes, calvados and applejack from fermented\\napples, kirsch from fermented cherries, slivovitz from fermented plums.)\\n        Unless they contain added sugar or cream, spirits have no nutrients other than alcohol.\\nUnlike food, which has to be metabolized before your body can use it for energy, alcohol\\ncan be absorbed into the blood-stream directly from the gastrointestinal tract. Ethyl alcohol\\nprovides 7 calories per gram.\\n\\nThe Most Nutritious Way to Serve This Food\\nThe USDA/Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines for Americans defines one drink\\nas 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine, or 1.25 ounces of distilled spirits, and “moderate\\ndrinking” as two drinks a day for a man, one drink a day for a woman.\\n\\nDiets That May Restrict or Exclude This Food\\nBland diet\\nLactose-free diet (cream cordials made with cream or milk)\\nLow-purine (antigout) diet\\n\\nBuying This Food\\nLook for:      Tightly sealed bottles stored out of direct sunlight, whose energy might disrupt\\nthe structure of molecules in the beverage and alter its flavor.\\n        Choose spirits sold only by licensed dealers.

Warming the liquid excites these molecules and intensifies the\\nflavor and aroma, which is the reason we serve brandy in a round glass with a narrower top\\nthat captures the aromatic molecules as they rise toward the air when we warm the glass by\\nholding it in our hands. Whiskies, too, though traditionally served with ice in America, will\\nhave a more intense flavor and aroma if served at room temperature.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nThe  heat  of  cooking  evaporates  the  alcohol  in  spirits  but  leaves  the  flavoring  intact.  Like\\nother alcoholic beverages, spirits should be added to a recipe near the end of the cooking time\\nto preserve the flavor while cooking away any alcohol bite.\\n        Alcohol is an acid. If you cook it in an aluminum or iron pot, it will combine with metal\\nions to form dark compounds that discolor the pot and the food you are cooking. Any recipe\\nmade with spirits should be prepared in an enameled, glass, or stainless-steel pot.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\n* * *\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nReduced risk of heart attack.           Data from the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention\\nStudy 1, a 12-year survey of more than 1 million Americans in 25 states, shows that men\\nwho take one drink a day have a 21 percent lower risk of heart attack and a 22 percent lower\\nrisk of stroke than men who do not drink at all. Women who have up to one drink a day also\\nreduce their risk of heart attack. Numerous later studies have confirmed these findings.\\nLower  cholesterol  levels.       Beverage  alcohol  decreases  the  body’s  production  and  storage  of\\nlow density lipoproteins (LDLs), the protein and fat particles that carry cholesterol into your\\narteries. As a result, people who drink moderately tend to have lower cholesterol levels and\\nhigher  levels  of  high  density  lipoproteins  (HDLs),  the  fat  and  protein  particles  that  carry\\ncholesterol out of the body. Numerous later studies have confirmed these findings.\\nLower  risk  of  stroke.       In  January  1999,  the  results  of  a  677-person  study  published  by\\nresearchers at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University showed that moderate\\nalcohol consumption reduces the risk of stroke due to a blood clot in the brain among older\\npeople (average age: 70). How alcohol prevents stroke is still unknown, but it is clear that\\nmoderate use is a key. Heavy drinkers (those who consume more than seven drinks a day)\\nhave a higher risk of stroke.

Alcoholic  beverages  stimulate  the  production  of  saliva  and  the\\ngastric acids that cause the stomach contractions we call hunger pangs. Moderate amounts\\nof alcoholic beverages, which may help stimulate appetite, are often prescribed for geriatric\\npatients, convalescents, and people who do not have ulcers or other chronic gastric problems\\nthat might be exacerbated by the alcohol.\\nDilation  of  blood  vessels.       Alcoholic  beverages  dilate  the  tiny  blood  vessels  just  under  the\\nskin, bringing blood up to the surface. That’s why moderate amounts of alcoholic beverages\\n(0.2–1 gram per kilogram of body weight, or two ounces of whiskey for a 150-pound adult)\\ntemporarily warm the drinker.

Alcoholism  is  an  addiction  disease,  the  inability  to  control  one’s  alcohol\\nconsumption.  It  is  a  potentially  life-threatening  condition,  with  a  higher  risk  of  death  by\\naccident, suicide, malnutrition, or acute alcohol poisoning, a toxic reaction that kills by para-\\nlyzing body organs, including the heart.\\nFetal  alcohol  syndrome.         Fetal  alcohol  syndrome  is  a  specific  pattern  of  birth  defects—low\\nbirth weight, heart defects, facial malformations, learning disabilities, and mental retarda-\\ntion—first  recognized  in  a  study  of  babies  born  to  alcoholic  women  who  consumed  more\\nthan six drinks a day while pregnant. Subsequent research has found a consistent pattern of\\nmilder defects in babies born to women who drink three to four drinks a day or five drinks\\non any one occasion while pregnant. To date there is no evidence of a consistent pattern of\\nbirth defects in babies born to women who consume less than one drink a day while preg-\\nnant,  but  two  studies  at  Columbia  University  have  suggested  that  as  few  as  two  drinks  a\\nweek while pregnant may raise a woman’s risk of miscarriage. (One drink is 12 ounces of\\nbeer, five ounces of wine, or 1.25 ounces of distilled spirits.)\\nIncreased risk of breast cancer.           In 2008, scientists at the National Cancer Institute released\\ndata from a seven-year survey of more than 100,000 postmenopausal women showing that\\neven moderate drinking (one to two drinks a day) may increase by 32 percent a woman’s\\nrisk of developing estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) and progesterone-receptor positive (PR+)\\nbreast  cancer,  tumors  whose  growth  is  stimulated  by  hormones.  No  such  link  was  found\\nbetween consuming alcohol and the risk of developing ER-/PR- tumors (not fueled by hor-\\nmones).

In the mid-1990s, studies at the University\\n of Oklahoma suggested that men who drink more than five beers a day are at increased risk\\n of rectal cancer. Later studies suggested that men and women who are heavy beer or spirits\\n drinkers (but not those who are heavy wine drinkers) have a higher risk of colorectal cancers.\\n Further studies are required to confirm these findings.\\n Malnutrition.       While  moderate  alcohol  consumption  stimulates  appetite,  alcohol  abuses\\n depresses it. In addition, an alcoholic may drink instead of eating. When an alcoholic does\\n eat, excess alcohol in his/her body prevents absorption of nutrients and reduces the ability\\n to synthesize new tissue.\\n Hangover.      Alcohol  is  absorbed  from  the  stomach  and  small  intestine  and  carried  by  the\\n bloodstream  to  the  liver,  where  it  is  oxidized  to  acetaldehyde  by  alcohol  dehydrogenase\\n (ADH), the enzyme our bodies use every day to metabolize the alcohol we produce when\\n we  digest  carbohydrates.  The  acetaldehyde  is  converted  to  acetyl  coenzyme  A  and  either\\n eliminated from the body or used in the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and body tis-\\n sues. Although individuals vary widely in their capacity to metabolize alcohol, an adult of\\n average size can metabolize the alcohol in four ounces (120 ml) whiskey in approximately\\n five to six hours. If he or she drinks more than that, the amount of alcohol in the body will\\n exceed  the  available  supply  of  ADH.  The  surplus,  unmetabolized  alcohol  will  pile  up  in\\n the  bloodstream,  interfering  with  the  liver’s  metabolic  functions.  Since  alcohol  decreases\\n the reabsorption of water from the kidneys and may inhibit the secretion of an antidiuretic\\n hormone, the drinker will begin to urinate copiously, losing magnesium, calcium, and zinc\\n but retaining uric acid, which is irritating. The level of lactic acid in the body will increase,\\n making him or her feel tired and out of sorts; the acid-base balance will be out of kilter; the\\n blood vessels in the head will swell and throb; and the stomach, its lining irritated by the\\n alcohol, will ache. The ultimate result is a hangover whose symptoms will disappear only\\n when enough time has passed to allow the body to marshal the ADH needed to metabolize\\n the extra alcohol in the person’s blood.\\n Changes  in  body  temperature.          Alcohol  dilates  capillaries,  tiny  blood  vessels  just  under  the\\n skin, producing a “flush” that temporarily warms the drinker. But drinking is not an effective\\n way to stay warm in cold weather. Warm blood flowing up from the body core to the surface\\n capillaries is quickly chilled, making you even colder when it circulates back into your organs.\\n In addition, an alcohol flush triggers perspiration, further cooling your skin. Finally, very large\\n amounts of alcohol may actually depress the mechanism that regulates body temperature.\\n Impotence.      Excessive drinking decreases libido (sexual desire) and interferes with the ability\\n to achieve or sustain an erection.\\n Migraine  headache.          Some  alcoholic  beverages  contain  chemicals  that  inhibit  PST,  an\\nenzyme that breaks down certain alcohols in spirits so that they can be eliminated from the\\nbody. If they are not broken down by PST, these alcohols will build up in the bloodstream\\nand may trigger a migraine headache.

Although  some\\nnitrosamines are known or suspected carcinogens, this natural chemical conversion presents\\nno  known  problems  for  a  healthy  adult.  However,  when  these  nitrate-rich  vegetables  are\\ncooked and left to stand at room temperature, bacterial enzyme action (and perhaps some\\nenzymes  in  the  plants)  convert  the  nitrates  to  nitrites  at  a  much  faster  rate  than  normal.\\nThese higer-nitrite foods may be hazardous for infants; several cases of “spinach poisoning”\\nhave been reported among children who ate cooked spinach that had been left standing at\\nroom temperature.\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\nMAO inhibitors.         Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are drugs used as antidepressants\\nor antihypertensives. They inhibit the action of enzymes that break down tyramine, a natu-\\nral by-product of protein metabolism, so that it can be eliminated from the body. Tyramine\\nis a pressor amine, a chemical that constricts blood vessels and raises blood pressure. If you\\neat a food rich in tyramine while you are taking an MAO inhibitor, the pressor amine can-\\nnot  be  eliminated  from  your  body,  and  the  result  may  be  a  hypertensive  crisis  (sustained\\nelevated blood pressure). Eggplants contain small amounts of tyramine.\\nFalse-positive urine test for carcinoid tumors.            Carcinoid tumors (tumors that may arise in tis-\\nsues of the endocrine and gastrointestinal systems) secrete serotonin, which is excreted in\\nurine. The test for these tumors measures the level of serotonin in your urine.

They, too, are suscep-\\n tible to Salmonella contamination and should never be left at room temperature.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nFirst, find out how fresh the eggs really are. The freshest ones are the eggs that sink and lie\\nflat on their sides when submerged in cool water. These eggs can be used for any dish. By\\nthe time the egg is a week old, the air pocket inside, near the broad end, has expanded so\\nthat the broad end tilts up as the egg is submerged in cool water. The yolk and the white\\ninside have begun to separate; these eggs are easier to peel when hard-cooked. A week or\\ntwo later, the egg’s air pocket has expanded enough to cause the broad end of the egg to\\npoint straight up when you put the egg in water. By now the egg is runny and should be\\nused in sauces where it doesn’t matter if it isn’t picture-perfect. After four weeks, the egg\\nwill float. Throw it away.\\n                             Eggs are easily contaminated with Salmonella microorganisms that can slip through an\\nintact shell. never eat or serve  a  dishor   beverage containingraw  fresh eggs .  salmonella\\n          destroyedbycookingeggs to aninternal temperature of  145° f ;  egg milkdishes  suchas                       -\\nis\\ncustards   mustbecooked to an  internal temperature of  160° f.\\n                             If you separate fresh eggs by hand, wash your hands thoroughly before touching other\\nfood, dishes, or cooking tools. When you have finished preparing raw eggs, wash your hands\\nand all utensils thoroughly with soap and hot water. never stircooked eggs with autensil\\nused   on raweggs .\\n                             When you whip an egg white, you change the structure of its protein molecules which\\n unfold,  breaking  bonds  between  atoms  on  the  same  molecule  and  forming  new  bonds  to\\n atoms  on  adjacent  molecules.  The  result  is  a  network  of  protein  molecules  that  hardens\\n around air trapped in bubbles in the net. If you beat the whites too long, the foam will turn\\n stiff enough to hold its shape even if you don’t cook it, but it will be too stiff to expand natu-\\n rally if you heat it, as in a soufflé. When you do cook properly whipped egg white foam, the\\n hot air inside the bubbles will expand. Ovalbumin, an elastic protein in the white, allows\\n the bubble walls to bulge outward until they are cooked firm and the network is stabilized\\n as a puffy soufflé.\\n                             The bowl in which you whip the whites should be absolutely free of fat or grease, since\\n the fat molecules will surround the protein molecules in the egg white and keep them from\\n linking up together to form a puffy white foam.

As the egg cooks, the protein network tightens, squeez-\\ning out moisture, and the egg becomes opaque. The longer you cook the egg, the tighter the\\nnetwork  will  be.  If  you  cook  the  egg  too  long,  the  protein  network  will  contract  strongly\\nenough  to  force  out  all  the  moisture.  That  is  why  overcooked  egg  custards  run  and  why\\novercooked eggs are rubbery.\\n        If you mix eggs with milk or water before you cook them, the molecules of liquid will\\nsurround and separate the egg’s protein molecules so that it takes more energy (higher heat)\\nto  make  the  protein  molecules  coagulate.  Scrambled  eggs  made  with  milk  are  softer  than\\nplain scrambled eggs cooked at the same temperature.\\n        When you boil an egg in its shell, the air inside expands and begins to escape through\\nthe  shell  as  tiny  bubbles.  Sometimes,  however,  the  force  of  the  air  is  enough  to  crack  the\\nshell.  Since  there’s  no  way  for  you  to  tell  in  advance  whether  any  particular  egg  is  strong\\nenough to resist the pressure of the bubbling air, the best solution is to create a safety vent\\nby sticking a pin through the broad end of the egg before you start to boil it. Or you can\\nslow the rate at which the air inside the shell expands by starting the egg in cold water and\\nletting  it  warm  up  naturally  as  the  water  warms  rather  than  plunging  it  cold  into  boiling\\nwater—which makes the air expand so quickly that the shell is virtually certain to crack.\\n        As the egg heats, a little bit of the protein in its white will decompose, releasing sulfur\\nthat  links  up  with  hydrogen  in  the  egg,  forming  hydrogen  sulfide,  the  gas  that  gives  rot-\\nten  eggs  their  distinctive  smell.  The  hydrogen  sulfide  collects  near  the  coolest  part  of  the\\negg—the yolk. The yolk contains iron, which now displaces the hydrogen in the hydrogen\\nsulfide to form a green iron-sulfide ring around the hard-cooked yolk.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nEgg substitutes.       Fat-free, cholesterol-free egg substitutes are made of pasteurized egg whites,\\nplus artificial or natural colors, flavors, and texturizers (food gums) to make the product look\\nand taste like eggs, plus vitamins and minerals to produce the nutritional equivalent of a full\\negg.  Pasteurized  egg  substitutes  may  be  used  without  additional  cooking,  that  is,  in  salad\\ndressings and eggnog.\\nDrying.

The egg yolk is a rich source of the yellow-orange carotenoid pigments\\nlutein  and  zeaxanthin.  Both  appear  to  play  a  role  in  protecting  the  eyes  from  damaging\\nultraviolet light, thus reducing the risk of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration, a\\nleading cause of vision of loss in one-third of all Americans older than 75. Just 1.3 egg yolks a\\nday appear to increase blood levels of lutein and zeaxanthin by up to 128 percent. Perhaps as\\na result, data released by the National Eye Institute’s 6,000-person Beaver Dam (Wisconsin)\\nEye  Study  in  2003  indicated  that  egg  consumption  was  inversely  associated  with  cataract\\nrisk in study participants who were younger than 65 years of age when the study started.\\nThe relative risk of cataracts was 0.4 for people in the highest category of egg consumption,\\ncompared to a risk of 1.0 for those in the lowest category.\\nExternal cosmetic effects.         Beaten egg whites can be used as a facial mask to make your skin\\nlook smoother temporarily. The mask works because the egg proteins constrict as they dry\\non your face, pulling at the dried layer of cells on top of your skin. When you wash off the\\negg white, you also wash off some of these loose cells. Used in a rinse or shampoo, the pro-\\ntein in a beaten raw egg can make your hair look smoother and shinier temporarily by filling\\nin chinks and notches on the hair shaft.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nIncreased risk of cardiovascular disease.            Although egg yolks are high in cholesterol, data from\\nseveral recent studies suggest that eating eggs may not increase the risk of heart disease. In\\n2003,  a  report  from  a  14-year,  177,000-plus  person  study  at  the  Harvard  School  of  Public\\nHealth showed that people who eat one egg a day have exactly the same risk of heart disease\\nas those who eat one egg or fewer per week. A similar report from the Multiple Risk Factor\\nIntervention Trial showed an inverse relationship between egg consumption and cholesterol\\nlevels—that is, people who ate more eggs had lower cholesterol levels.\\n        Nonetheless, in 2006 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute still recommends\\nno more than four egg yolks a week (including the yolk in baked goods) for a heart-healthy\\ndiet. The American Heart Association says consumers can have one whole egg a day if they\\nlimit  cholesterol  from  other  sources  to  the  amount  suggested  by  the  National  Cholesterol\\nEducation Project following the Step I and Step II diets. (Both groups permit an unlimited\\nnumber of egg whites.)\\n        The Step I diet provides no more than 30 percent of total daily calories from fat, no\\nmore  than  10  percent  of  total  daily  calories  from  saturated  fat,  and  no  more  than  300  mg\\nof cholesterol per day.

As figs ripen, the pectin in their cell walls dissolves and the figs grow softer to\\nthe touch. The largest, best-tasting figs are generally the ones harvested and shipped in late\\nspring and early summer, during June and July.\\n        Choose dried figs in tightly sealed airtight packages.\\nAvoid:     Fresh  figs  that  smell  sour.  The  odor  indicates  that  the  sugars  in  the  fig  have  fer-\\nmented; such fruit is spoiled.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nRefrigerate  fresh  figs.  Dried  figs  can  be  stored  in  the  refrigerator  or  at  room  temperature;\\neither way, wrap them tightly in an air- and moistureproof container to keep them from los-\\ning moisture and becoming hard. Dried figs may keep for several months.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nWash fresh figs under cool water; use dried figs right out of the package. If you want to slice\\nthe dried figs, chill them first in the refrigerator or freezer: cold figs slice clean.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nFresh figs contain ficin, a proteolytic (protein-breaking) enzyme similar to papain in papayas\\nand  bromelin  in  fresh  pineapple.  Proteolytic  enzymes  split  long-chain  protein  molecules\\ninto smaller units, which is why they help tenderize meat. Ficin is most effective at about\\n140–160°F, the temperature at which stews simmer, and it will continue to work after you\\ntake the stew off the stove until the food cools down. Temperatures higher than 160°F inac-\\ntivate  ficin;  canned  figs—which  have  been  exposed  to  very  high  heat  in  processing—will\\nnot tenderize meat.\\n        Both fresh and dried figs contain pectin, which dissolves when you cook the figs, mak-\\ning them softer. Dried figs also absorb water and swell.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nDrying.      Figs contain polyphenoloxidase, an enzyme that hastens the oxidation of phenols\\nin the fig, creating brownish compounds that darken its flesh. To prevent this reaction, figs\\nmay be treated with a sulfur compound such as sulfur dioxide or sodium sulfite. People who\\nare sensitive to sulfites may suffer serious allergic reactions, including potentially fatal ana-\\nphylactic shock, if they eat figs that have been treated with one of these compounds.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Plastic keeps out air, encouraging\\nthe growth of bacteria that make the fish smell bad. If the fish smells bad when you open\\nthe package, throw it out.\\n        Refrigerate all fresh and smoked fish immediately. Fish spoils quickly because it has a\\nhigh proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (which pick up oxygen much more easily than\\nsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids). Refrigeration also slows the action of microorgan-\\nisms on the surface of the fish that convert proteins and other substances to mucopolysac-\\ncharides, leaving a slimy film on the fish.\\n        Keep fish frozen until you are ready to use it.\\n        Store canned fish in a cool cabinet or in a refrigerator (but not the freezer). The cooler\\nthe temperature, the longer the shelf life.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nFresh  fish.     Rub  the  fish  with  lemon  juice,  then  rinse  it  under  cold  running  water.  The\\nlemon  juice  (an  acid)  will  convert  the  nitrogen  compounds  that  make  fish  smell  “fishy”  to\\ncompounds that break apart easily and can be rinsed off the fish with cool running water.\\nRinsing your hands in lemon juice and water will get rid of the fishy smell after you have\\nbeen preparing fresh fish.\\nFrozen fish.      Defrost plain frozen fish in the refrigerator or under cold running water. Pre-\\npared frozen fish dishes should not be thawed before you cook them since defrosting will\\nmake the sauce or coating soggy.\\nSalted dried fish.      Salted dried fish should be soaked to remove the salt. How long you have\\nto soak the fish depends on how much salt was added in processing. A reasonable average\\nfor salt cod, mackerel, haddock (finnan haddie), or herring is three to six hours, with two or\\nthree changes of water.\\n        When you are done, clean all utensils thoroughly with hot soap and hot water. Wash\\nyour cutting board, wood or plastic, with hot water, soap, and a bleach-and-water solution.\\nFor ultimate safety in preventing the transfer of microorganisms from the raw fish to other\\nfoods, keep one cutting board exclusively for raw fish, meats, and poultry, and a second one\\nfor everything else.

Like heat, acids coagulate the proteins in fish, squeezing out moisture. Fish\\nmarinated in citrus juices and other acids such as vinegar or wine has a firm texture and\\nlooks cooked, but the acid bath may not inactivate parasites in the fish.\\nCanning.       Fish is naturally low in sodium, but canned fish often contains enough added\\nsalt  to  make  it  a  high-sodium  food.  A  3.5-ounce  serving  of  baked,  fresh  red  salmon,  for\\nexample, has 55 mg sodium, while an equal serving of regular canned salmon has 443 mg.\\nIf the fish is canned in oil it is also much higher in calories than fresh fish.\\nFreezing.      When fish is frozen, ice crystals form in the flesh and tear its cells so that mois-\\nture leaks out when the fish is defrosted. Commercial flash-freezing  offers some protec-\\ntion by freezing the fish so fast that the ice crystals stay small and do less damage, but all\\ndefrosted  fish  tastes  drier  and  less  palatable  than  fresh  fish.  Freezing  slows  but  does  not\\nstop the oxidation of fats that causes fish to deteriorate.\\nCuring.      Fish can be cured (preserved) by smoking, drying, salting, or pickling, all of which\\ncoagulate the muscle tissue and prevent microorganisms from growing. Each method has\\nits  own  particular  drawbacks.  Smoking  adds  potentially  carcinogenic  chemicals.  Drying\\nreduces the water content, concentrates the solids and nutrients, increases the calories per\\nounce, and raises the amount of sodium.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nProtection  against  cardiovascular  disease.             The  most  important  fats  in  fish  are  the  poly-\\nunsaturated acids known as omega-3s. These fatty acids appear to work their way into\\nheart  cells  where  they  seem  to  help  stabilize  the  heart  muscle  and  prevent  potentially\\nfatal arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). Among 85,000 women in the long-running Nurses’\\nHealth Study, those who ate fatty fish at least five times a week were nearly 50 percent\\nless likely to die from heart disease than those who ate fish less frequently.

According to the Merck Manual, fish is one of the 12 foods most likely to\\ntrigger classic food allergy symptoms: hives, swelling of the lips and eyes, and upset stom-\\nach. The others are berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries), chocolate,\\ncorn, eggs, legumes (green peas, lima beans, peanuts, soybeans), milk, nuts, peaches, pork,\\nshellfish, and wheat (see wheatcereals). NOTE: Canned tuna products may contain sulfites\\nin vegetable proteins used to enhance the tuna’s flavor. People sensitive to sulfites may suf-\\nfer serious allergic reactions, including potentially fatal anaphylactic shock, if they eat tuna\\ncontaining  sulfites.  In  1997,  tuna  manufacturers  agreed  to  put  warning  labels  on  products\\nwith sulfites.\\nEnvironmental contaminants.            Some fish are contaminated with methylmercury, a compound\\nproduced by bacteria that chemically alters naturally occurring mercury (a metal found in\\nrock and soil) or mercury released into water through industrial pollution. The methylmer-\\ncury is absorbed by small fish, which are eaten by larger fish, which are then eaten by human\\nbeings. The larger the fish and the longer it lives the more methylmercury it absorbs. The\\nmeasurement used to describe the amount of methylmercury in fish is ppm (parts per mil-\\nlion). Newly-popular tilapia, a small fish, has an average 0.01 ppm, while shark, a big fish,\\nmay have up to 4.54 ppm, 450 times as much.\\n        That  is  a  relatively  small  amount  of  methylmercury;  it  will  soon  make  its  way\\nharmlessly out of the body. But even small amounts may be hazardous during pregnancy\\nbecause  methylmercury  targets  the  developing  fetal  nervous  system.

However, some studies suggest that the size of\\nthe fiber particles may have some bearing on their ability to absorb moisture and “bulk up”\\nstool and that the fiber particles found in fine-ground whole wheat flours may be too small\\nto have a bulking effect.\\n        Finely ground whole wheat flour is called whole wheat cake flour; coarsely ground whole\\nwheat  flour  is  called  graham  flour.  Cracked  wheat  is  a  whole  wheat  flour  that  has  been  cut\\nrather than ground; it has all the nutrients of whole wheat flour, but its processing makes it\\nless likely to yield its starch in cooking. When dried and parboiled, cracked wheat is known\\nas bulgur, a grain used primarily as a cereal, although it can be mixed with other flours and\\nbaked. Gluten flour is a low-starch, high-protein product made by drying and grinding hard-\\nwheat flour from which the starch has been removed.\\nRefined (“white”) flours.           Refined flours are paler than whole wheat flours because they do\\nnot contain the brown bran and germ. They have less fiber and fat and smaller amounts of\\nvitamins and minerals than whole wheat flours, but enriched refined flours are fortified with B\\nvitamins and iron. Refined flour has no phytic acid.\\n        Some  refined  flours  are  bleached  with  chlorine  dioxide  to  destroy  the  xanthophylls\\n(carotenoid  pigments)  that  give  white  flours  a  natural  cream  color.  Unlike  carotene,  the\\ncarotenoid pigment that is converted to vitamin A in the body, xanthophylls have no vita-\\nmin A activity; bleaching does not lower the vitamin A levels in the flour, but it does destroy\\nvitamin E.\\n        There are several kinds of white flours. All-purpose white flour is a mixture of hard and\\nsoft wheats, high in protein and rich in gluten.  Cake flour is a finely milled soft-wheat flour;\\nit has less protein than all-purpose flour. Self-rising flour is flour to which baking powder has\\nbeen added and is very high in sodium. Instant flour is all-purpose flour that has been ground\\nextra-fine so that it will combine quickly with water. Semolina is a pale high-protein, low-\\ngluten flour made from durum wheat and used to make pasta.\\nRye  flours.      Rye  flour  has  less  gluten  than  wheat  flour  and  is  less  elastic,  which  is  why  it\\nmakes a denser bread.\\n        Like whole wheat flour, dark rye flour (the flour used for pumpernickel bread) contains\\nthe bran and the germ of the rye grain; light rye flour (the flour used for ordinary rye bread)\\n\\n*    The bran is the kernel’s hard, brown outer cover, an extraordinarily rich source of cellulose and lignin.\\n    The endosperm is the kernel’s pale interior, where the vitamins abound.

The gluten network can stretch to accommodate the gas (carbon\\ndioxide) formed when you add yeast to bread dough or heat a cake batter made with baking\\npowder or baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), trapping the gas and making the bread dough\\nor cake batter rise.

Choose a package with no leaks\\nor stains to suggest previous defrosting.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nKeep  frozen  game  meat  well  wrapped  in  the  freezer  until  you  are  ready  to  use  it.  The\\npackaging  protects  the  meat  from  oxygen  that  can  change  its  pigments  from  reddish  to\\nbrown. Freezing prolongs the freshness of the meat by slowing the natural multiplication\\nof bacteria that digest proteins and other substances on the surface, converting them to a\\nslimy film. The bacteria also change the meat’s sulfur-containing amino acids methionine\\nand cystine into smelly chemicals called mercaptans. When the mercaptans combine with\\nmyoglobin,  they  produce  the  greenish  pigment  that  gives  spoiled  meat  its  characteristic\\nunpleasant appearance. Large cuts of game meat can be safely frozen, at 0°F, for six months\\nto a year.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nDefrost the meat in the refrigerator to protect it from spoilage. Trim the meat to dispose of\\nall visible fat, thus reducing the amount of fat and cholesterol in each serving.\\n        When you are done, clean all utensils thoroughly with hot soap and hot water.

(NOTE: Browning has one minor nutritional drawback. It breaks amino\\nacids on the surface of the meat into smaller compounds that are no longer useful proteins.)\\n        When meat is heated, it loses water and shrinks. Its pigments, which combine with\\noxygen, are denatured (broken into fragments) by the heat. They turn brown, the natural\\ncolor of well-done meat. At the same time, the fats in the meat are oxidized, a reaction that\\nproduces a characteristic warmed-over flavor when the cooked meat is refrigerated and then\\nreheated. Cooking and storing the meat under a blanket of antioxidants—catsup or a gravy\\nmade of tomatoes, peppers and other vitamin-C rich vegetables—reduces fat oxidation and\\nlessens the warmed-over flavor. Meat reheated in a microwave oven is also less likely to taste\\nwarmed-over.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nAging.     Hanging fresh meat exposed to air in a cold room evaporates moisture and shrinks\\nthe meat slightly. At the same time, bacterial action on the surface of the meat breaks down\\nproteins, producing an “aged” flavor. (See below, Food/drug interactions.)\\nCuring.     Salt-curing preserves meat through osmosis, the physical reaction in which liquids\\nflow across a membrane, such as the wall of a cell, from a less dense to a more dense solu-\\ntion.  The  salt  or  sugar  used  in  curing  dissolve  in  the  liquid  on  the  surface  of  the  meat  to\\nmake a solution that is more dense than the liquid inside the cells of the meat. Water flows\\nout of the meat and out of the cells of any microorganisms living on the meat, killing the\\nmicro-organisms and protecting the meat from bacterial damage. Salt-cured meat is higher\\nin sodium than fresh meat.\\nSmoking.      Hanging  fresh  meat  over  an  open  fire  slowly  dries  the  meat,  kills  microorgan-\\nisms on its surface, and gives the meat a rich, smoky flavor. The flavor varies with the wood\\nused in the fire. Meats smoked over an open fire are exposed to carcinogenic chemicals in\\nthe smoke, including  a-benzopyrene. Artificial smoke flavoring is commercially treated to\\nremove tar and a-benzopyrene.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nTreating and/or preventing iron deficiency.

Or you can put a head of fresh, raw garlic on a flat surface and hit the flat end with the\\nflat side of a knife. The head will come apart and the skin should come off easily.\\n        To get the most “garlicky” taste from garlic cloves, chop or mash them or extract the\\noil  with  a  garlic  press.  When  you  cut  into  a  garlic  clove,  you  tear  its  cell  walls,  releasing\\nan enzyme that converts sulfur compounds in the garlic into ammonia, pyruvic acid, and\\ndiallyl disulfide.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nHeating  garlic  destroys  its  diallyl  disulfide,  which  is  why  cooked  garlic  is  so  much  milder\\ntasting than raw garlic.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Drying removes moisture from garlic but leaves the oils intact. Powdered garlic and\\ngarlic salt should be stored in a cool, dry place to keep their oils from turning rancid. Garlic\\nsalt is much higher in sodium than either raw garlic, garlic powder, or dried garlic flakes.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nProtection against some cancers.           The organic sulfur compounds in garlic and onions appear to\\nreduce the risk of some forms of cancer perhaps by preventing the formation of carcinogens\\nin your body or by blocking carcinogens from reaching or reacting with sensitive body tis-\\nsues or by inhibiting the transformation of healthy cells to malignant ones.\\nProtection  against  circulatory  diseases.         In  a  number  of  laboratory  studies  during  the  1980s,\\nadding  garlic  oil  to  animal  feeds  reduced  levels  of  low-density  lipoproteins  (LDLs),  the\\nfat  and  protein  particles  that  carry  cholesterol  into  your  arteries,  and  raised  levels  of  high\\ndensity lipoproteins (HDLs), the particles that carry cholesterol out of the body. However,\\ncurrent studies are contradictory. One year-long study at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center\\nshowed that daily doses of aged garlic (brand name Kyolic) appeared to reduce the formation\\nof  cholesterol  deposits  in  arteries  while  lowering  blood  levels  of  homocysteine,  an  amino\\nacid the American Heart Association calls an independent risk factor for heart disease. But\\nanother study funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine\\n(NCCAM), a division of the National Institutes of Health, to determine the safety and effec-\\ntiveness of garlic showed that neither fresh garlic nor powdered garlic nor garlic tablets have\\nany effect on cholesterol levels.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nBody odor, halitosis.        Diallyl disulfide is excreted in perspiration and in the air you exhale,\\nwhich is why eating garlic makes you smell garlicky.\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\nAnticoagulants (blood thinners).           Garlic appears to reduce blood’s ability to clot, thus increas-\\ning the effect of anticoagulants, including aspirin.

Red  grapes  are  colored  with  anthocyanin  pigments  that  turn  deeper  red  in  acids\\nand blue, purple, or yellowish in basic (alkaline) solutions. As a result, red grape juice will\\nturn  brighter  red  if  you  mix  it  with  lemon  or  orange  juice.  Since  metals  (which  are  basic)\\nwould also change the color of the juice, the inside of grape juice cans is coated with plastic\\nor enamel to keep the juice from touching the metal. Since 2000, following several deaths\\nattributed  to  unpasteurized  apple  juice  contaminated  with  E.  coli  O157:H7,  the  FDA  has\\nrequired that all juices sold in the United States be pasteurized to inactivate harmful organ-\\nisms such as bacteria and mold.\\nWine-making.          Grapes are an ideal fruit for wine-making. They have enough sugar to pro-\\nduce  a  product  that  is  10  percent  alcohol  and  are  acidic  enough  to  keep  unwanted  micro-\\norganisms  from  growing  during  fermentation.  Some  wines  retain  some  of  the  nutrients\\noriginally present in the grapes from which they are made. (See wine .)\\n Drying.

Grape skin, pulp,\\nand  seed  contain  resveratrol,  one  of  a  group  of  plant  chemicals  credited  with  lowering\\ncholesterol and thus reducing the risk of heart attack by preventing molecular fragments\\ncalled  free  radicals  from  linking  together  to  form  compounds  that  damage  body  cells,\\nleading to blocked arteries (heart disease), glucose-damaged blood vessels (diabetes), and\\nunregulated cell growth (cancer).\\n        The  juice  from  purple  grapes  has  more  resveratrol  than  the  juice  from  red  grapes,\\nwhich  has  more  resveratrol  than  the  juice  from  white  grapes.  More  specifically,  in  1998,\\na  team  of  food  scientists  from  the  USDA  Agricultural  Research  Service  identified  a  native\\nAmerican grape, the muscadine, commonly used to make grape juice in the United States, as\\nan unusually potent source of resveratrol.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Today, that string has been bred out of most green beans, but you may\\nstill find it in wax beans and in haricots verts, the true French green beans.\\n       To prepare green beans and wax beans, wash them under cool running water, pick off\\nodd leaves or stems, snip off the ends, pull the string off wax beans or haricots verts, and slice\\nor sliver the beans.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nCooking reduces the amount of vitamin C in green beans and wax beans but does not affect\\nthe vitamin A, which is insoluble in water and stable at normal cooking temperatures.\\n       Green  beans  will  change  color  when  you  cook  them.  Chlorophyll,  the  pigment  that\\nmakes green vegetables green, is sensitive to acids. When you heat green beans, the chloro-\\nphyll in the beans will react chemically with acids in the vegetable or in the cooking water,\\nforming pheophytin, which is brown. The pheophytin makes the beans look olive-drab.\\n       To keep green beans green, you have to keep the chlorophyll from reacting with acids.\\nOne way to do this is to cook the beans in a large quantity of water (which will dilute the\\nacids), but this increases the loss of vitamin C. A second alternative is to leave the lid off\\nthe pot so that the volatile acids can float off into the air. The best way may be to steam\\nor microwave the green beans very quickly in very little water so that they hold onto their\\nvitamin C and cook so fast that there is no time for the chlorophyll to react with the acids.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nCanning and freezing.         Commercially frozen green beans and wax beans have virtually the\\nsame nutritional value as fresh beans. Canned beans, however, usually have added salt that\\nturns  the  naturally  low-sodium  beans  into  a  high-sodium  food.

When you\\nheat  greens,  the  chlorophyll  in  the  leaves  reacts  chemically  with  acids  in  the  greens  or  in\\nthe cooking water, forming pheophytin, which is brown. Together, the pheophytin and the\\nyellow carotenes in dark green leaves give the cooked greens a bronze hue. Greens with few\\ncarotenes will look olive-drab.\\n        To keep the cooked greens from turning bronze or olive, you have to prevent the chlo-\\nrophyll from reacting with acids. One way to do this is to cook the greens in a large amount\\nof  water  (which  will  dilute  the  acids),  but  this  increases  the  loss  of  vitamin  C.  A  second\\nalternative is to leave the lid off the pot so that the volatile acids can float off into the air.\\nThe best way probably is to steam the greens in very little water, or, as researchers at Cornell\\nUniversity suggest, to microwave two cups of greens with about three tablespoons of water\\nin a microwave safe plastic bag left open at the top so that steam can escape. These methods\\npreserve vitamin C and cook the greens so fast that there is no time for the chlorophyll/acid\\nreaction to occur.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.     Cooked frozen greens have more fiber and vitamin A than cooked fresh greens\\nbecause, ounce for ounce, they have less water and more leaf solids.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nLower risk of some birth defects.           As many as two of every 1,000 babies born in the United\\nStates each year may have cleft palate or a neural tube (spiral cord) defect due to their moth-\\ners’  not  having  gotten  adequate  amounts  of  folate  during  pregnancy.  The  current  RDA  for\\nfolate is 180 mcg for a woman and 200 mcg for a man, but the FDA now recommends 400 mcg\\nfor a woman who is or may become pregnant. Taking folate supplements before becoming\\npregnant and continuing through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the risk of cleft\\npalate; taking folate through the entire pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\\nVision protection.       Dark greens are a rich source of the yellow-orange carotenoid pigments\\nlutein  and  zeaxanthin.

According  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  from\\n1996–2005 the proportion of incidents of food-borne disease linked to leafy greens increased\\nby 60 percent. The highest proportion of these illnesses were due to contamination by noro-\\nvirus (the organism often blamed for outbreaks of gastric illness on cruise ships), followed\\nby salmonella and E. coli. The illnesses were commonly associated with eating raw greens;\\ncooking the greens to a high heat inactivates the disease-causing organisms.\\nNitrates.     Like beets, celery, eggplant, lettuce, radishes, and spinach, greens contain nitrates\\nthat convert naturally into nitrites in your stomach and then react with the amino acids in\\nproteins  to  form  nitrosamines.  Although  some  nitrosamines  are  known  or  suspected  car-\\ncinogens, this natural chemical conversion presents no known problems for a healthy adult.\\nHowever, when these nitrate-rich vegetables are cooked and left to stand at room tempera-\\nture, bacterial enzyme action (and perhaps some enzymes in the plants) convert the nitrates\\nto nitrites at a much faster rate than normal. These higher-nitrite foods may be hazardous\\nfor infants; several cases of “spinach poisoning” have been reported among children who ate\\ncooked spinach that had been left standing at room temperature.\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\nAnticoagulants        Greens  are  rich  in  vitamin  K,  the  blood-clotting  vitamin  produced  natu-\\nrally by bacteria in the intestines.

It retains moisture longer while a cake or bread is baking, and it may even extract\\n   moisture  from  the  air  into  the  finished  product.  As  a  result,  breads  and  cakes  made  with\\n   honey stay moist longer than those made with sugar.\\n           Honey also appears to enhance the Maillard reaction, a heat-triggered transformation\\n   of sugars that turns toast brown, caramelizes custards, and crisps the surface of meats. The\\n   Maillard reaction creates antioxidants that slow down fat’s natural oxidation (rancidity).

Meat  labeled  baby  lamb  or  spring  lamb  comes  from  animals  less  than  five\\nmonths old; lamb comes from an animal less than a year old; mutton comes from an animal\\nolder than a year. The older the animal, the tougher and more sinewy the meat.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nRefrigerate fresh lamb immediately, carefully wrapped to prevent its drippings from contam-\\ninating other foods. Refrigeration prolongs freshness by slowing the natural multiplication\\nof bacteria on the surface of the meat. Left on their own, these bacteria convert proteins and\\nother  substances  on  the  surface  of  the  meat  to  a  slimy  film  and  change  the  meat’s  sulfur-\\ncontaining  amino  acids  methionine  and  cystine  into  smelly  chemicals  called  mercaptans.\\nWhen the mercaptans combine with pigments in meat, they produce the greenish pigment\\nthat gives spoiled meat its characteristic unpleasant appearance.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nTrim  the  meat  carefully.  By  judiciously  cutting  away  all  visible  fat,  you  can  significantly\\nreduce the amount of fat and cholesterol in each serving.

Because the only sugars in\\n    lamb are the small amounts of glycogen in its muscles, we often add sugar in the form of\\n    marinades or basting liquids that may also contain acids (lemon juice, vinegar, wine, yogurt)\\n    to  break  down  muscle  fibers  and  tenderize  the  meat.  (Note  that  browning  has  one  minor\\n    nutritional  drawback.  It  breaks  amino  acids  on  the  surface  of  the  meat  into  smaller  com-\\n    pounds that are no longer useful proteins.)\\n           When lamb is heated, it loses water and shrinks. Its pigments, which combine with\\n    oxygen, are denatured by the heat. They break into smaller fragments and turn brown, the\\n    natural color of well-done meat.

Cooking and storing meat under a blanket of antioxidants—catsup or a gravy made\\n    of tomatoes, peppers, and other vitamin C-rich vegetables—reduces the oxidation of fats and\\n    the intensity of warmed-over flavor. So will reheating the meat in a microwave rather than\\n    a conventional oven.\\n\\n    How Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\n    Canning.      Canned lamb does not develop a warmed-over flavor because the high temperatures\\n    used in canning food and alter the structure of the proteins in the meat so that the proteins act\\n    as antioxidants. Once the can is open, however, lamb fat may begin to oxidize again.\\n    Freezing.     Defrosted frozen lamb may be less tender than fresh lamb. It may also be lower\\n    in B vitamins. When you freeze lamb, the water inside its cells freezes into sharp ice crys-\\n    tals  that  can  puncture  cell  membranes.  When  the  lamb  thaws,  moisture  (and  some  of  the\\n    B  vitamins)  will  leak  out  through  these  torn  cell  walls.  Freezing  may  also  cause  freezer\\n    burn—dry spots left when moisture evaporates from the lamb’s surface. Waxed freezer paper\\n    is designed specifically to protect the moisture in meat; plastic wrap and aluminum foil may\\n    be less effective.\\n\\n    Medical Uses and/or Benefits\\n    Treating and/or preventing iron deficiency.          Without meat it is virtually impossible for a woman of\\n    childbearing age to get the 18 mg iron/day she requires unless she takes an iron supplement.\\n\\n    Adverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n    Increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Beans are digested very slowly, produc-\\n ing only a gradual rise in blood-sugar levels.

For patients with type 2\\n diabetes (who can produce some insulin), the bean diet reduced the need for injected insulin\\n by 98 percent.

Although beans are very high in calories, they have so much fiber that even\\n a small serving can make you feel full.

In  fact,  research  at  the  University  of\\n Toronto suggests the insulin-sparing effect may last for several hours after you eat the beans,\\n perhaps until after your next meal.

This is a natural oxidation reaction that changes the color\\nbut doesn’t affect the nutritional value of the lettuce. Trim the end of the core (or remove the\\ncore from iceberg lettuce) to slow the reaction. Throw out any lettuce that feels slimy or has\\nbright red, dark brown, or black spots. The slime is the residue of bacterial decomposition;\\nthe dark spots may be mold or rot.\\n        Do not store unwrapped lettuce near apples, pears, melons, or bananas. These fruits\\nrelease ethylene gas, a natural ripening agent that will cause the lettuce to develop brown\\nspots.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nWash  all  lettuce,  including  lettuce  sold  in  “pre-washed”  packages  of  salad  mix,  to  flush\\nout debris.\\n        Never slice, cut, or tear lettuce until you are ready to use it. When lettuce cells are\\ntorn, they release ascorbic acid oxidase, an enzyme that destroys vitamin C.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nChlorophyll, the pigment that makes green vegetables green, is sensitive to acids. When you\\nheat lettuce, the chlorophyll in its leaves will react chemically with acids in the vegetable or\\nin the cooking water, forming pheophytin, which is brown. Together, the pheophytin and\\nthe yellow carotenes in dark green leaves will give the cooked lettuce a bronze hue. (Lighter\\nleaves, with very little carotene, will be olive-drab.)\\n        To  keep  cooked  lettuce  green,  you  have  to  keep  the  chlorophyll  from  reacting  with\\nacids. One way to do this is to cook the lettuce in a large quantity of water (which will dilute\\nthe acids), but this will accelerate the loss of vitamin C. A second alternative is to cook the\\nlettuce with the lid off the pot so that the volatile acids will float off into the air. The best\\nway may be to steam the lettuce quickly in very little water, so that it holds onto its vitamin\\nC and cooks before the chlorophyll has time to react with the acids.\\n        Heat also makes the water inside the lettuce cells expand. Eventually the cells rupture\\nand the water leaks out, leaving the lettuce limp. The spines will remain stiffer because they\\ncontain more cellulose, which does not dissolve in water. Cooked lettuce has less vitamin C\\nthan fresh lettuce because heat destroys the vitamin.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\n* * *\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nLower risk of some birth defects.

One cup shredded romaine lettuce has 78 mg folate.\\nPossible lower risk of heart attack.          In the spring of 1998, an analysis of data from the records\\nfor more than 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses’ Health Study at Harvard\\nSchool of Public Health/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, demonstrated that a diet\\nproviding more than 400 mcg folate and 3 mg vitamin B 6 daily, either from food or supple-\\nments,  might  reduce  a  woman’s  risk  of  heart  attack  by  almost  50  percent.

According  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  from\\n1996–2005 the proportion of incidents of food-borne disease linked to leafy greens increased\\nby 60 percent. The highest proportion of these illnesses were due to contamination by noro-\\nvirus (the organism often blamed for outbreaks of gastric illness on cruise ships), followed\\nby salmonella and E. coli. The illnesses were commonly associated with eating raw greens;\\ncooking the greens to a high heat inactivates the disease-causing organisms.\\nNitrate  poisoning.       Lettuce,  like  beets,  celery,  eggplant,  radishes,  spinach,  and  collard  and\\nturnip greens, contains nitrates that convert naturally into nitrites in your stomach, and then\\nreact with the amino acids in proteins to form nitrosamines. Although some nitrosamines\\nare  known  or  suspected  carcinogens,  this  natural  chemical  conversion  presents  no  known\\nproblems for a healthy adult. However, when these nitrate-rich vegetables are cooked and left\\nto stand at room temperature, bacterial enzyme action (and perhaps some enzymes in the\\nplants) convert the nitrates to nitrites at a much faster rate than normal.

Drying  reduces  the  moisture  and  concentrates  the  calories  and  nutrients  in  lima\\nbeans.\\nCanning and freezing.         Frozen fresh lima beans contain about the same amounts of vitamins\\nand minerals as fresh beans; canned lima beans are lower in vitamins but usually contain\\nmore sodium in the form of added salt.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nLower risk of some birth defects.          Up to two of every 1,000 babies born in the United States\\neach year may have cleft palate or a neural tube (spinal cord) defect due to their mothers’\\nnot having gotten adequate amounts of folate during pregnancy. The current RDA for folate\\nis  180  mcg  for  a  woman  and  200  mcg  for  a  man,  but  FDA  now  recommends  400  mcg  for\\na  woman  who  is  or  may  become  pregnant.  Taking  a  folate  supplement  before  becoming\\npregnant and continuing through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the risk of cleft\\npalate; taking folate through the entire pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\\nPossible  lower  risk  of  heart  attack.        In  the  spring  of  1998,  an  analysis  of  data  from  the\\nrecords for more than 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses’ Health Study at\\nHarvard School of Public Health/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, demonstrated\\nthat  a  diet  providing  more  than  400  mcg  folate  and  3  mg  vitamin  B 6   daily,  either  from\\nfood or supplements, might reduce a woman’s risk of heart attack by almost 50 percent.\\nAlthough men were not included in the study, the results were assumed to apply to them\\nas well.\\n       However,  data  from  a  meta-analysis  published  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical\\nAssociation in December 2006 called this theory into question. Researchers at Tulane Univer-\\nsity examined the results of 12 controlled studies in which 16,958 patients with preexisting\\ncardiovascular disease were given either folic acid supplements or placebos (“look-alike” pills\\nwith no folic acid) for at least six months. The scientists, who found no reduction in the risk\\nof further heart disease or overall death rates among those taking folic acid, concluded that\\nfurther studies will be required to ascertain whether taking folic acid supplements reduces\\nthe risk of cardiovascular disease.\\nTo reduce the levels of serum cholesterol.

The first theory is that the pectins in the beans form a gel in your stomach that\\n sops up fats so that they cannot be absorbed by your body. The second is that bacteria in the\\n gut feed on the bean fiber, producing chemicals called short-chain fatty acids that inhibit the\\n production of cholesterol in your liver.\\n As  a  source  of  carbohydrates  for  people  with  diabetes.            Beans  are  digested  very  slowly,  pro-\\nducing only a gradual rise in blood-sugar levels. As a result, the body needs less insulin to\\ncontrol blood sugar after eating beans than after eating some other high-carbohydrate foods\\n(bread or potato). In studies at the University of Kentucky, researchers put diabetic patients\\non a bean-grains-fruit-and-vegetables diet developed at the University of Toronto and recom-\\nmended by the American Diabetes Association. On the diet, patients with type 1 diabetes\\n(whose bodies do not produce any insulin) to cut their insulin intake by 38 percent. Patients\\nwith  type  2  diabetes  (who  can  produce  some  insulin)  were  able  to  reduce  their  insulin\\ninjections by 98 percent. This diet is in line with the nutritional guidelines of the American\\nDiabetes Association, but people with diabetes should always consult their doctors and/or\\ndietitians before altering their diet.\\nAs a diet aid.       Although beans are very high in calories, they have so much bulky fiber that\\neven a small serving can make you feel full. And, since beans are insulin-sparing (because\\nthey don’t cause blood-sugar levels to rise quickly), they postpone the natural surge of insu-\\nlin  that  triggers  hunger  pangs.  In  fact,  research  at  the  University  of  Toronto  suggests  the\\ninsulin-sparing effect may last for several hours after eating beans, perhaps even until after\\nthe next meal.\\n\\n Adverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n Intestinal  gas.     All  legumes  (beans  and  peas)  contain  raffinose  and  stachyose,  sugars  that\\ncannot be digested by human beings. Instead, they are fermented by bacteria living in the\\nintestinal  tract,  producing  the  gassiness  many  people  associate  with  eating  beans.  Since\\nraffinose  and  stachyose  leach  out  of  the  limas  into  the  water  when  you  cook  lima  beans,\\ndiscarding the water in which you cook fresh limas beans or presoak dried ones may make\\nthem less gassy.\\nAllergic reaction.       According to the Merck Manual, legumes (including lima beans) are one of\\n the 12 foods most likely to trigger classic food allergy symptoms: hives, swelling of the lips\\n and eyes, and upset stomach.

Vitamin  A  is  stored  in  the  liver,  so  this  organ  is  an  extremely  rich\\nsource  of  retinol,  the  true  vitamin  A.  In  large  doses,  retinol  is  poisonous.  The  RDA  for  a\\nwoman is 2,310 IU; for a man, 2,970. Doses of 50,000 IU a day over a period of weeks have\\nproduced symptoms of vitamin A poisoning; single doses of 2,000,000–5,000,000 IU may\\nproduce  acute  vitamin  A  poisoning  (drowsiness,  irritability,  headache,  vomiting,  peeling\\nskin).  This  reaction  was  documented  in  early  arctic  explorers  who  ate  large  amounts  of\\npolar bear liver and in people who eat the livers of large fish (shark, halibut, cod), which may\\ncontain up to 100,000 IU vitamin A per grams. In infants, as little as 7.5 to 15 mg of retinol\\na day for 30 days has produced vomiting and bulging fontanel. In 1980 there was a report\\nof chronic vitamin A intoxication in infants fed 120 grams (4 ounces) of chicken liver plus\\nvitamin supplements containing 2000 IU vitamin A, yellow vegetable and fruits, and vita-\\nmin A-enriched milk every day for four months.

According to the American Cancer Society, foods rich in beta-\\ncarotenes  may  lower  the  risk  of  cancers  of  the  larynx,  esophagus  and  lungs.  There  is  no\\nsimilar benefit from beta-carotene supplements; indeed, one study actually showed a higher\\nrate of lung cancer among smokers taking the supplement.\\nLower risk of heart attack.       In the spring of 1998, an analysis of data from the records for more\\nthan 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses Health Study at Harvard School of\\nPublic Health/Brigham and Woman’s Hospital in Boston identified the first direct link between\\ntwo B vitamins and heart health. According to Eric B. Rimm, M.D., of the Harvard School of\\nPublic Health, a diet that provides more than 400 mcg folate and 3 mg vitamin B  a day from                         6\\neither food or supplements, more than twice the current RDA for each, may reduce a woman’s\\nrisk of heart attack by almost 50 percent. Although men were not included in the analysis, the\\nresults  are  presumed  to  apply  to  them  as  well.  Many  melons  are  high  in  folate;  green  leafy\\nvegetables, beans, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry, and shellfish are other good sources.\\nLower risk of some birth defects.          As many as two of every 1,000 babies born in the United\\nStates each year may have cleft palate or a neural tube (spinal cord) defect due to their moth-\\ners’  not  having  gotten  adequate  amounts  of  folate  during  pregnancy.  The  current  RDA  for\\nfolate is 180 mcg for a woman and 200 mcg for a man, but the FDA now recommends 400 mcg\\nfor a woman who is or may become pregnant. Taking folate supplements before becoming\\npregnant and continuing through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the risk of cleft\\npalate; taking folate through the entire pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n* * *\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\n* * *', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The\\n     primary  protein  in  milk  is  casein  in  the  milk  solids;  the  whey  (liquid)\\n /   contains lactalbumin and lactoglobulin.                                               About half the calories in whole milk come from milk fat, a highly\\n     saturated  fat  that  is  lighter  than  water,  rises  to  the  top,  and  can  be\\n     skimmed  off  as  cream.  Homogenized  milk  is  whole  milk  that  has  been\\n     processed  through  machinery  that  breaks  its  fat  globules  into  fragments\\n w   small enough to remain suspended in the liquid rather than floating to the\\n     top. Whole milk is high in cholesterol.\\n             Whole  milk,  which  get  its  creamy  color  comes  from  beta-carotene\\n     and  other  yellow  pigments  in  foods  eaten  by  milk  cows  and  goats,  is  a\\n ^   naturally excellent source of vitamin A. Because vitamin A is fat-soluble, it\\n     is lost when milk is skimmed. Low-fat and nonfat milks are fortified with\\n     added vitamin A; all fresh cow’s milk sold in the United States is fortified\\n     with  vitamin  D.  Milk  is  a  good  source  of  B  vitamins,  including  vitamin\\n ?   B 6 , a “visible vitamin” whose green pigment is masked by the carotenes in\\n     whole milk.

Opaque plastic cartons reduce the flow of light into the milk but do not\\nblock it completely.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nChill, pour, and serve. Never pour unused milk or cream back into the original container. Doing\\nthat might introduce bacteria that can contaminate all the other milk in the bottle or carton.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nWhen milk is warmed, its tightly-curled protein molecules relax and unfold, breaking inter-\\nnal bonds (bonds between atoms on the same molecule) and forming new, intermolecular\\nbonds between atoms on neighboring molecules. The newly linked protein molecules create\\na network with water molecules caught in the net. As the milk cooks, the network tightens,\\nsqueezing out the water molecules and forming the lumps we call curds.\\n       Casein, the proteins that combine with calcium to form the “skin” on top of hot milk,\\nwill also form curds if you make the milk more acid by adding lemon juice, fruit, vegetables,\\nvinegar, or wine. Whey proteins do not coagulate when you make the milk more acid, but\\nthey  precipitate  (fall  to  the  bottom  of  the  pot)  when  the  milk  is  heated  to  a  temperature\\nabove 170°F. If the bottom of the pot gets hotter, the whey proteins will scorch and the milk\\nwill smell burnt.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.     Milk that has been frozen and defrosted has less vitamin C and B vitamins than\\nfresh milk. Freezing also changes the taste and texture of milk. First, it breaks up milk’s pro-\\ntein molecules. When the milk is defrosted, they clump together so that the milk no longer\\ntastes perfectly smooth. Second, freezing slows but does not stop the natural oxidation of\\nmilk’s fat molecules. The longer milk is frozen, the more fat molecules will oxidize and the\\nstronger the milk will taste.\\nDrying.     Dried  milk  tastes  cooked  because  it  has  been  heated  to  evaporate  its  moisture.\\nUnopened packages of dried milk should be stored in a cool, dry cabinet where they may hold\\ntheir flavor and nutrients for several months. Once dried milk is opened, it should be stored in\\na tightly closed container to keep out the moisture that will encourage bacterial growth and\\nchange the flavor of the milk. Once the dried milk is reconstituted, it should be refrigerated.\\nCondensed  and  evaporated  milk.            Evaporated  and  condensed  milks  have  been  cooked  to\\nevaporate moisture; condensed milk has added sugar. Both evaporated and condensed milk\\nhave a cooked flavor. They also have less vitamin C and vitamin B 6 than fresh milk.\\n       Unopened cans of condensed or evaporated milk should be stored in a cool, dark cabi-\\nnet. Unopened cans of evaporated milk will keep for one month at 90°F, one to two years at\\n70°F, and two years or more at 39°F.

Raw  (unpasteurized)  milk  may  contain  a  variety  of\\nmicroorganisms, including pathogenic and harmless bacteria, plus yeasts and molds that are\\ndestroyed when the milk is pasteurized (heated to 145°F for 30 minutes or 160°F for 15 sec-\\nonds). Ultrapasteurized milk has been heated to 280°F for two seconds or more. The higher\\ntemperature destroys more microorganisms than pasteurization and prolongs the shelf life of\\nthe milk and cream (which must be refrigerated). Ultra-high-temperature sterilization heats\\nthe milk to 280°–302°F for two to six seconds. The milk or cream is then packed into prester-\\nilized containers and aseptically sealed so that bacteria that might spoil the milk cannot enter.\\nAseptically packaged milk, which is widely available in Europe, can be stored on an unrefrig-\\nerated grocery or kitchen shelf for as long as three months without spoiling or losing any of\\nits vitamins.

The most common form of osteoporosis (literally, “bones full\\nof  holes”)  is  an  age-related  loss  of  bone  density  most  obvious  in  postmenopausal  women.\\nStarting at menopause, women may lose 1 percent of bone density every year for the rest of\\ntheir lives. Men also lose bone, but at a slower rate. As a result, women are more likely to\\nsuffer bone fractures; six of seven Americans who suffer a broken hip are women.\\n        A lifelong diet with adequate amounts of calcium can help stave off bone loss later in\\nlife.  Current  studies  and  two  National  Institutes  of  Health  Conferences  suggest  that  post-\\nmenopausal  women  who  are  not  using  hormone  replacement  therapy  should  get  at  least\\n1,500 mg calcium a day, the amount of calcium in five glasses of nonfat milk.\\nReduced  risk  of  hypertension  (high  blood  pressure).

It is designed for healthy people whose cholesterol is in the range of\\n 200–239 mg/dL.\\n        The Step II diet provides 25–35 percent of total calories from fat, less than 7 percent\\n of total calories from saturated fat, up to 10 percent of total calories from polyunsaturated\\n fat, up to 20 percent of total calories from monounsaturated fat, and less than 300 mg cho-\\n lesterol per day. This stricter regimen is designed for people who have one or more of the\\n following conditions:\\n\\n        u   Existing cardiovascular disease\\n        u   High  levels  of  low-density  lipoproteins  (LDLs,or  “bad”  cholesterol)  or  low\\n            levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs, or “good” cholesterol)\\n        u   Obesity\\n        u   Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes, or diabetes mellitus)\\n        u   Metabolic syndrome, a.k.a. insulin resistance syndrome, a cluster of risk fac-\\n            tors that includes type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes)\\n\\n Lactose intolerance.       Lactose intolerance—the inability to digest the sugar in milk—is not an\\n allergy. It is an inherited metabolic deficiency that affects two-thirds of all adults, including\\n 90 to 95 percent of all Asians, 70 to 75 percent of all blacks, and 6 to 8 percent of Caucasians.\\n These people do not have sufficient amounts of lactase, the enzyme that breaks lactose (a\\n disaccharide) into its easily digested components, galactose and glucose. When they drink\\n milk, the undigested sugar is fermented by bacteria in the gut, causing bloating, diarrhea,\\n flatulence, and intestinal discomfort. Some milk is now sold with added lactase to digest the\\n lactose and make the milk usable for lactase-deficient people.\\n Galactosemia.        Lactose, the sugar in milks, is a disaccharide (“double sugar”) made of one\\n molecule of glucose and one molecule of galactose.

About 100 of the more than 1,000 varieties of mushrooms are poison-\\nous. In the United States, nearly 90 percent of all mushroom poisoning is due to two species\\nof  Amanita  mushrooms,  Amanita  muscaria  and  Amanita  phalloides.  Amanita  muscaria  contains\\nmuscarine,  a  parasympathetic-nervous-system  poison  that  can  cause  tearing,  salivation,\\nsweating,  vomiting,  cramps  and  diarrhea,  dizziness,  confusion,  coma,  and  convulsions.\\nThese symptoms may show up anywhere from a few minutes to two hours after you eat the\\nmushrooms. Muscarine poisoning is potentially fatal. Phalloidin, the toxin in Amanita phal-\\nloide mushrooms, is a liver poison whose symptoms include all those attributed to muscarine\\npoisoning, plus jaundice from liver damage. These symptoms may not show up until two to\\nthree days after you eat the mushrooms. Phalloidin is a potentially lethal poison; the death\\nrate for phalloidin poisoning is 50 percent.\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\nFalse-positive test for occult blood in the stool.      The active ingredient in the guaiac slide test for hid-\\nden blood in feces is alphaguaiaconic acid, a chemical that turns blue in the presence of blood.\\nAlphaguaiaconic  acid  also  turns  blue  in  the  presence  of  peroxidase,  a  chemical  that  occurs\\nnaturally in mushrooms. Eating mushrooms in the 72 hours before taking the guaiac test may\\nproduce a false-positive result in people who not actually have any blood in their stool.\\nAlcohol/disulfiram  interaction.

For  example,  shelled  pecans  stay  fresh  up  to  one  year  in  the  freezer  against\\nabout two months on a cool, dark kitchen shelf.\\n        Check the nuts occasionally; throw out any moldy nuts or any that have shriveled.\\n        Do not shell nuts until you are ready to use them. The shell is a natural protective\\nshield.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nAlmonds.       To  peel  shelled  almonds,  boil  the  nuts,  drain  them,  and  plunge  them  into  cold\\nwater. The skin should slip off easily.\\nBrazil nuts.      Brazil nuts are easy to open if you chill them first. To slice shelled Brazil nuts,\\nboil the nuts in water for five minutes, then cool and slice. Or you can shave them into sliv-\\ners with a potato peeler.\\nCashews.       Always cook raw cashews before you shell them. Between the shell and the raw\\nnut is a thin layer of urushiol, the irritating oil also found in poison oak and poison ivy. The\\noil is inactivated by heat.\\nChestnuts.      Slice an X in the flat end of the chestnut and peel off the heavy outer skin. To\\nremove the thin inner skin, bake the chestnuts on a cookie sheet in a 400°F oven for about\\ntwenty  minutes  or  cover  them  with  boiling  water  and  simmer  them  for  fifteen  minutes.\\nThen drain the nuts and slip off the skins.\\nMacadamia nuts.          To open macadamia nuts, wrap them, one at a time, in a heavy cloth nap-\\nkin or towel, put the package on a wooden breadboard, and hit the nut with a hammer.\\nPecans and walnuts.

As many as two of every 1,000 babies born in the United\\nStates  each  year  may  have  cleft  palate  or  a  neural  tube  (spinal  cord)  defect  due  to  their\\nmothers’ not having gotten adequate amounts of folate during pregnancy. The current RDA\\nfor folate is 180 mcg for a woman and 200 mcg for a man, but the FDA now recommends\\n400 mcg for a woman who is or may become pregnant. Taking folate supplements before\\nbecoming pregnant and continuing through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the\\nrisk  of  cleft  palate;  taking  folate  through  the  entire  pregnancy  reduces  the  risk  of  neural\\ntube defects.\\nLower levels of cholesterol.         Although nuts are high in fat, they are low in saturated fat and,\\nas plant foods, have no cholesterol at all. Several recent studies have shown that eating nuts\\nlowers blood levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs, or “bad” cholesterol)\\nwhile raising blood levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs, or “good” cholesterol).\\n        At  Loma  Linda  University  (California),  volunteers  with  mildly  elevated  cholesterol\\nlevels  were  given  two  diets.  First  they  tried  the  American  Heart  Association  (AHA)  Step\\nI diet, the low-fat, controlled-cholesterol regimen generally used as a first step in reducing\\ncholesterol levels. Then, they got the same diet with one small adjustment: 20 percent of its\\ndaily calories came from a handful of nuts (almonds, pecans, or walnuts) mixed into cereals,\\nsalads, and entries such as pasta. The result: While the AHA Step I diet lowered total cho-\\nlesterol 5.2 percent, when volunteers added nuts their cholesterol levels fell as much as 11.3\\npercent. Even better, while LDLs dropped 6.1 percent on the AHA diet, they fell a whopping\\n16.5  percent  with  pecans.  This  is  significant  because  the  National  Cholesterol  Education\\nProgram estimates that your risk of heart attack declines 1.5 percent for every 1 percent drop\\nin LDLs. Loma Linda researchers had similar results with the diets that included almonds\\nor walnuts.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nAllergic reaction.

In 1998, scientists at Wayne State University in Detroit\\n   conducted  a  meta-analysis  of  data  from  more  than  30  well-designed  animal  studies  mea-\\n   suring the anti-cancer effects of wheat bran, the part of grain with highest amount of the\\n   insoluble dietary fibers cellulose and lignin. They found a 32 percent reduction in the risk\\n   of colon cancer among animals fed wheat bran; now they plan to conduct a similar meta-\\n   analysis of human studies. Like wheat bran, whole oats are a good source of insoluble dietary\\n   fiber. NOTE: The amount of fiber per serving listed on a food package label shows the total\\n   amount of fiber (insoluble and soluble).\\n          Early  in  1999,  however,  new  data  from  the  long-running  Nurses  Health  Study  at\\n   Brigham  Women’s  Hospital/Harvard  University  School  of  Public  Health  showed  that\\n   women who ate a high-fiber diet had a risk of colon cancer similar to that of women who\\n   ate a low fiber diet.

Nonetheless,  many  nutrition  researchers  remain  wary  of  ruling\\n   out a protective effect for dietary fiber. They note that there are different kinds of dietary\\n   fiber that may have different effects, that most Americans do not consume a diet with the\\n   recommended  amount  of  dietary  fiber,  and  that  gender,  genetics,  and  various  personal\\n   health  issues  may  also  affect  the  link  between  dietary  fiber  and  the  risk  of  colon  cancer.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The second is that bacteria in the gut may\\n feed on the fiber in the oats and produce short chain fatty acids that inhibit the production\\n of cholesterol in your liver.\\n                              A 1990 study at the University of Kentucky showed that adding 1/ cup oat bran (mea-\\n sured  when  dry)  to  you  daily  diet  can  reduce  levels  of  LDLs  by  as  much  as  25  percent.

The oats were given credit for about one-third of the drop in cholesterol\\n levels; the rest went to the low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.\\n                              In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use on labels of health claims\\n for oats such as: “Soluble fiber from foods such as oat bran, as part of a diet low in saturated\\n fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease.”\\n Calming effect.

The chemical, identified in 1985 by researchers\\n   at the University of St. Louis (Missouri), turns into sulfuric acid when it comes into contact\\n   with water, which is why it stings if it gets into your eyes. You can prevent this by slicing\\n   fresh onions under running water, diluting the propanethial-S-oxide before it can float up\\n   into the air.\\n           Another way to inactivate propanethial-S-oxide is to chill the onion in the refrigerator\\n   for an hour or so before you slice it.

This browning of sugars and\\namino acids is called the Maillard reaction, after the French chemist who first identified it.\\n        Onions may also change color when cooked. Onions get their creamy color from antho-\\nxanthins,  pale-yellow  pigments  that  turn  brown  if  they  combine  with  metal  ions.  (That’s\\nwhy onions discolor if you cook them in an aluminum or iron pot or slice them with a car-\\nbon-steel knife.) Red onions contain anthocyanin pigments that turn redder in acid (lemon\\njuice, vinegar) and bluish in a basic (alkaline) solution. And the chlorophyll molecules that\\nmake the tops of green onions green are sensitive to acids. When heated, chlorophyll reacts\\nwith acids in the vegetable or in the cooking water to produce pheophytin, which is brown.\\nThe pheophytin makes green onion tops olive-drab. To keep green onions green, you have to\\nreduce the interaction between the chlorophyll and the acids.

The  key  to  preserving\\nvitamin  C  is  to  protect  the  juice  from  heat  and  air  (which  might  seep  in  through  plastic\\nbottles). The juice should fill the bottle as high as possible, so that there is very little space\\nat the top for oxygen to gather. Stored this way, the juice may hold its vitamin C for two\\nweeks.

Do not\\ngrate deeper than the colored part of the skin; if you hit the white underneath, you will be\\ngetting bitter-tasting components in with the rind.\\n        Orange  peel  contains  volatile  fragrant  oils  whose  molecules  are  liberated  when  the\\nskin is torn and its cell walls ruptured. These molecules are also more fragrant at room tem-\\nperature than when cold. “Eating oranges” have a much truer aroma and flavor if you let them\\ncome to room temperature before peeling and serving.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nHeat destroys the vitamin C but not the flavoring oils in an orange.

Oranges  are  high  in  pectin,  which  appears  to  slow  the  body’s\\nabsorption of fats and lower cholesterol levels. There are currently two theories about how\\nthis happens. The first is that the pectins dissolve into a gel that sops up fats in your stom-\\nach so that your body cannot absorb them. The second is that bacteria in the gut digest the\\nfiber and then produce short chain fatty acids that slow down the liver’s natural production\\nof cholesterol.\\nPossible lower risk of heart attack.           In the spring of 1998, an analysis of data from the records\\nfor more than 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses’ Health Study at Harvard\\nSchool of Public Health/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, demonstrated that a diet\\nproviding more than 400 mcg folate and 3 mg vitamin B 6 daily, either from food or supple-\\nments,  might  reduce  a  woman’s  risk  of  heart  attack  by  almost  50  percent.  Although  men\\nwere not included in the study, the results were assumed to apply to them as well.\\n        However,  data  from  a  meta-analysis  published  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical\\nAssociation in December 2006 called this theory into question. Researchers at Tulane Univer-\\nsity examined the results of 12 controlled studies in which 16,958 patients with preexisting\\ncardiovascular disease were given either folic acid supplements or placebos (“look-alike” pills\\nwith no folic acid) for at least six months. The scientists, who found no reduction in the risk\\nof further heart disease or overall death rates among those taking folic acid, concluded that\\nfurther studies will be required to determine whether taking folic acid supplements reduces\\nthe risk of cardiovascular disease.\\nLower risk of stroke.

According  to  the  American  Cancer  Society,  a  diet  high  in\\nfoods rich in antioxidant vitamin C may reduce your risk of some cancers, such as cancer of\\nthe respiratory tract. In addition, oranges contain D-limonene, an aromatic compound found\\nin citrus oils. D-limonene is a monoterpene, a member of a family of chemicals that appears\\nto reduce the risk of some cancers, perhaps by preventing the formation of carcinogens in\\nyour body or by blocking carcinogens from reaching or reacting with sensitive body tissues\\nor by inhibiting the transformation of healthy cells to malignant ones.\\nLower risk of some birth defects.           Up to two of every 1,000 babies born in the United States\\neach year may have cleft palate or a neural tube (spinal cord) defect due to their mothers’ not\\nhaving gotten adequate amounts of folate during pregnancy. The current RDA for folate is\\n180 mcg for a woman and 200 mcg for a man, but the FDA now recommends 400 mcg for a\\nwoman who is or may become pregnant. Taking a folate supplement before becoming preg-\\nnant and through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the risk of cleft palate; taking\\nfolate through the entire pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\\nPotassium benefits.        Because potassium is excreted in urine, potassium-rich foods are often\\nrecommended for people taking diuretics. In addition, a diet rich in potassium (from food)\\nis associated with a lower risk of stroke. A 1998 Harvard School of Public Health analysis\\nof  data  from  the  long-running  Health  Professionals  Study  shows  38  percent  fewer  strokes\\namong men who ate nine servings of high potassium foods a day vs. those who ate fewer\\nthan four servings. Among men with high blood pressure, taking a daily 1,000 mg potas-\\nsium  supplement—about  the  amount  of  potassium  in  two  cups  orange  juice—reduced  the\\nincidence of stroke by 60 percent.\\nAntiscorbutics.      All citrus fruits are excellent sources of vitamin C, used to cure or prevent\\nthe vitamin C–deficiency disease scurvy. Your body also needs vitamin C in order to convert\\nthe amino acid proline into hydroxyproline, an essential ingredient in collagen, the protein\\nneeded to form skin, tendons, and bones. People with scurvy do not heal quickly, a condition\\nthat can be cured by feeding them foods rich in vitamin C. Whether taking extra vitamin\\nC  speeds  healing  in  healthy  people  remains  to  be  proved.  Oranges  and  other  citrus  fruits\\nalso contain rutin, hesperidin, and other natural chemicals known collectively as flavonoids\\n(“bioflavonoids”). In experiments with laboratory animals, flavonoids appear to strengthen\\ncapillaries, the tiny blood vessels just under the skin.

Parsnips that are darker in spots may have been frozen on the\\nway to market. Gray spots or soft spots warn of rot inside the root.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nKeep parsnips cold and humid so they won’t dry out. Store them in a root cellar or in the\\nrefrigerator.  In  storage,  parsnips  will  convert  some  of  their  starch  to  sugar.  As  a  rule  of\\nthumb, the sweeter the parsnip, the longer it has been stored.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nScrub the parsnips with a vegetable brush under cool running water or simply peel them—\\nbut not until you are ready to use them. When you peel or slice a parsnip, you tear its cell\\nwalls, releasing polyphenoloxidase, an enzyme that hastens the combination of oxygen with\\nphenols in the parsnips, turning the vegetable brown. You can slow this reaction (but not\\nstop it completely) by dipping raw peeled or sliced parsnips into an acid solution (lemon juice\\nand water, vinegar and water). Polyphenoloxidase also works more slowly in the cold, but\\nstoring peeled parsnips in the refrigerator is much less effective than an acid bath.\\n        You can keep parsnips from darkening in a stew by blanching them before you add them\\nto the dish. Boil the unpeeled parsnips for about 15 minutes to inactivate the polyphenoloxidase,\\nthen add them to the stew. If you prefer, you can freeze blanched parsnips for future use.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nHeat dissolves the pectic substances in the parsnip’s cell walls, making the vegetable softer.\\nAt the same time, the parsnip’s starch granules absorb water, swell, and eventually rupture,\\nreleasing nutrients inside and making the vegetables easier to digest.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.     When parsnips are frozen, liquids inside the vegetable’s cell form ice crystals that\\nmay  tear  the  cells,  allowing  moisture  to  escape  when  you  thaw  the  parsnips.  As  a  result,\\nwhen roots like carrots, potatoes, and parsnips are frozen and thawed, their texture is mushy\\nrather than crisp.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nLower risk of some birth defects.

Spinach  pasta\\n     adds  dried  spinach  for  taste  and  color.  High-protein  pasta  is  fortified  with\\n /   soy  flour.

In effect, adding salt forces the water\\nto boil at a higher temperature, which means the pasta will cook more quickly.\\n        The water should be boiling furiously before you add the pasta so that it can penetrate\\nthe pasta’s starch granules as fast as possible. Add the pasta slowly so that the water contin-\\nues to boil and the pasta cooks evenly.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nStarch consists of molecules of the complex carbohydrates amylose and amylopectin packed\\ninto a starch granule. When you boil pasta, water molecules force their way into the starch\\ngranules. When the water reaches a temperature of approximately 140°F, the amylose and\\namylopectin  molecules  inside  the  starch  granules  relax  and  unfold,  forming  new  bonds\\nbetween atoms on different molecules and creating a network inside the starch granule that\\ntraps water molecules. The granules bulk up and the pasta gets thicker. In fact, the starch\\ngranules can hold so much water that plain flour-and-water pastas like spaghetti, macaroni,\\nand lasagna will actually double in size.\\n        The longer you cook the pasta, the more likely it is that the starch granules will absorb\\ntoo much water and rupture, releasing some of their starch and making the pasta sticky. One\\nway to keep the pieces of pasta from sticking together is to cook them in a large pot, which\\ngives them room to boil without hitting their neighbors. Or you might add a tablespoon of\\nolive oil to make the pasta slick enough to slide apart. If you plan to refrigerate the cooked\\npasta, drain it, rinse it in warm water (to wash off the starch on the outside), and toss it with\\nolive oil.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nCanning and freezing.         When pasta is canned or frozen in sauce, its starch granules continue\\nto absorb the liquid and the pasta becomes progressively more limp.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nA lower risk of some kinds of cancer.

One way to increase the amount of glycogen in the muscles is to\\nincrease the amount of high-carbohydrate foods, such as pasta, in the diet, a regimen known\\nas carbohydrate loading. The classic carbohydrate-loading diet developed in Scandinavia in\\nthe  1960s  calls  for  two  days  on  a  very  low-carbohydrate  diet  plus  very  heavy  exercise  to\\ndeplete the muscles’ normal store of glycogen, followed by three days of very little exercise\\nand a diet which is 70 to 90 percent carbohydrates. Because so many athletes are reluctant to\\nstop exercising for three days before an event, a modified version of this regime, developed\\nat Ball State University in Indiana, suggests two days on a normal diet with normal to heavy\\nexercise, then three days on a diet very high in carbohydrates while exercise tapers down to\\nnothing on the day before the event. According to a number of studies by sports-medicine\\nresearchers, both versions of the carbohydrate-loading diet appear to increase the amount of\\nglycogen in the athlete’s muscles and thus to increase long-term stamina.\\nAs a source of carbohydrates for people with diabetes.                 Pasta is digested very slowly, producing\\nonly a gradual rise in blood-sugar levels. As a result, the body needs less insulin to control\\nblood sugar after eating pasta than after eating some other high-carbohydrate foods (rice,\\nbread, or corn). In studies at the University of Kentucky, a bean, whole-grain, vegetable, and\\nfruit-rich  diet  developed  at  the  University  of  Toronto  and  recommended  by  the  American\\nDiabetes Association enabled patients with type 1 diabetes (who do not produce any insulin\\nthemselves) to cut their daily insulin intake by 38 percent. For patients with type 2 diabetes\\n(who can produce some insulin), the bean diet reduced the need for injected insulin by 98\\npercent. This diet is in line with the nutritional guidelines of the American Diabetes Asso-\\nciation, but people with diabetes should always consult their doctor and/or dietitian before\\naltering their diet.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The red “blush” character-\\nistic of some varieties of peaches is not a reliable guide to ripeness. A better guide is the way\\nthe fruit feels and smells. Ripe peaches and nectarines have a warm, intense aroma and feel\\nfirm, with a slight softness along the line running up the length of the fruit.\\nAvoid:     Green  or  hard  unripe  peaches  and  nectarines.  As  peaches  and  nectarines  ripen\\nenzymes convert their insoluble pectic substances to soluble pectins and decrease their con-\\ncentration of bitter phenols. The longer the peach is left on the tree, the lower the concentra-\\ntion of phenols will be, which is why late-season peaches and nectarines are the sweetest.\\nOnce you pick the peach or nectarine, the enzyme action stops completely.

Once  they\\nhave  softened,  put  them  in  the  refrigerator.  The  cold  will  stop  the  enzymatic  action  that\\ndissolves pectins in the fruit and softens it.\\n        The pectin in freestone peaches is more soluble than the pectin in cling peaches, so ripe\\nfreestones are softer than ripe cling peaches (which stay firm even when cooked).

Grape skin, pulp, and\\n seed,  and  wines  made  from  grapes,  contain  resveratrol,  one  of  a  group  of  plant  chemicals\\n credited  with  lowering  cholesterol  and  thus  reducing  the  risk  of  heart  attack  by  prevent-\\n ing molecular fragments called free radicals from linking together to form compounds that\\n damage body cells leading to blocked arteries, glucose-damaged blood vessels (diabetes), and\\n unregulated  cell  growth  (cancer).  Peanuts  also  contain  resveratrol.  In  fact,  a  1998  analysis\\n from the USDA Agricultural Research Service in Raleigh, North Carolina, shows that pea-\\n nuts have 1.7 to 3.7 mcg resveratrol per gram of peanuts vs. 0.6 to 8.0 mcg resveratrol per\\n gram of red wine.\\n Possible lower risk of heart attack.         In the spring of 1998, an analysis of data from the records\\nfor more than 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses’ Health Study at Harvard\\nSchool of Public Health/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, demonstrated that a diet\\nproviding more than 400 mcg folate and 3 mg vitamin B 6 daily, either from food or supple-\\n ments,  might  reduce  a  woman’s  risk  of  heart  attack  by  almost  50  percent.  Although  men\\n were not included in the study, the results were assumed to apply to them as well.\\n        However,  data  from  a  meta-analysis  published  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical\\n Association in December 2006 called this theory into question. Researchers at Tulane Univer-\\n sity examined the results of 12 controlled studies in which 16,958 patients with preexisting\\n cardiovascular disease were given either folic acid supplements or placebos (“look-alike” pills\\n with no folic acid) for at least six months. The scientists, who found no reduction in the risk\\n of further heart disease or overall death rates among those taking folic acid, concluded that\\n further studies will be required to ascertain whether taking folic acid supplements reduces\\n the risk of cardiovascular disease.\\n Lower  cholesterol  levels.      A  1998  study  at  the  University  of  Rochester,  Pennsylvania  State\\n University, and the Bassett Research Institute suggests that a diet high in monounsaturated\\n fatty acids from peanut oil and peanut butter reduces levels of cholesterol and low density\\n lipoproteins (LDLs) without increasing levels of triglycerides (another form of fat considered\\n an independent risk factor for heart disease).\\n Lower risk of some birth defects.

Most fruit and vegetables get softer after they are picked\\nbecause their pectic enzymes begin to dissolve the pectin in their cell walls. With pears, this\\nreaction occurs if the pear is left on the tree to ripen, which is why tree-ripened pears some-\\ntimes taste mushy. The best-tasting pears are ones that are picked immature and allowed to\\nripen in storage or on your grocer’s shelf.\\n        Look for bright, clear-colored pears. Anjou pears are yellow to green (with some russet\\nshades) and have a bland, buttery flesh. Bartletts are clear golden or yellow with a reddish\\nblush and sweet, juicy flesh. Boscs are russet, sweet and juicy. Round Comice pears have a\\nyellow green skin and fine, juicy flesh. Red Seckel pears are firm and aromatic. Anjou, Bartlett,\\nand Bosc are good eating and cooking pears; Comice and Seckel pears are for eating.\\nAvoid:     Cut, shriveled, or bruised pears. They are probably discolored inside.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nStore pears at room temperature for a few days if they are not fully ripe when you buy them.\\nPears ripen from inside out, so you should never let a pear ripen until it is really soft on the\\nsurface. A ripe pear will yield when you press it lightly with your palm.\\n        Do not store pears in sealed plastic bags either in or out of the refrigerator. Without\\noxygen circulating freely around the pear, the fruit will begin to “breathe” internally, creat-\\ning compounds that turn the core brown and make brownish spots under the skin.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nHandle pears with care; never peel or slice them until you are ready to use them. When you\\nbruise a pear or slice into it, you tear its cells, releasing polyphenoloxidase, an enzyme that\\nhastens  the  oxidation  of  phenols  in  the  fruit,  producing  clumps  of  brownish  compounds\\nthat darken the pear’s flesh. You can slow this natural reaction (but not stop it completely)\\nby chilling the pears, brushing the cut surface with an acid solution (lemon juice and water,\\nvinegar and water), or mixing the peeled, sliced fruit into a fresh fruit salad with citrus fruits\\nfull of vitamin C, a natural antioxidant.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nLike other fruits and vegetables, pears have cell walls made of cellulose, hemicellulose, and\\npectic substances. As the fruit cooks and its pectins dissolve, it gets softer. But no amount\\nof cooking will dissolve the lignin particles in the pear flesh.

When you\\n   heat green peas, the chlorophyll in the peas reacts chemically with the acids in the vegetable\\n   or  in  the  cooking  water,  forming  pheophytin,  which  is  brown.  The  pheophytin  turns  the\\n   cooked peas olive-drab.\\n           To keep cooked peas green, you have to keep the chlorophyll from reacting with acids.\\n   One way to do this is to cook the peas in lots of water, which will dilute the acids. A second\\n   alternative is to leave the lid off the pot when you cook the peas so that the volatile acids can\\n   float off into the air. Or you can steam the peas in very little water or stir-fry them so fast\\n   that they cook before the chlorophyll has time to react with the acids. No matter how you\\n   cook the peas, save the cooking liquid. It contains the peas’ water-soluble B vitamins.\\n\\n   How Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\n   Drying.      Fresh green garden peas are immature seeds. The peas used to make dried split peas\\n   are mature seeds, may have twice as much starch as fresh peas, and are an extremely good\\n   source  of  protein.  A  cup  and  a  half  of  dried  split  peas,  which  will  weigh  about  14  ounces\\n   (400 grams) when cooked, has 20 to 25 grams protein, half the RDA for a healthy adult. Split\\n   peas don’t have to be soaked before cooking; in fact, soaking drains the B vitamins. When\\n   buying split peas, look for well-colored peas in a tightly sealed box or bag. Store the peas\\n   in an air- and moistureproof container in a cool, dry cupboard. When you are ready to use\\n   them, pick the peas over, discarding any damaged, broken, or withered ones along with any\\n   pebbles or other foreign matter.\\n           Dried split peas contain hemagglutinens, naturally occurring chemicals that cause red\\n   blood cells to clump together. Although the hemagglutinens in peas are not inactivated by\\n   cooking, they are not known to cause any ill effects in the amounts we usually eat.\\n\\n   Medical Uses and/or Benefits\\n   Lower  levels  of  cholesterol.      Foods  high  in  soluble  gums  and  pectins  appear  to  lower  the\\n   amount of cholesterol in the blood and offer some protection against heart disease. There are\\n   currently two theories to explain how this may happen. The first theory is that the pectins\\n   may form a gel in your stomach that sops up fats and keeps them from being absorbed by\\n   your body. The second is that bacteria in the gut may feed on fiber in the peas, producing\\n   short chain fatty acids that inhibit the production of cholesterol in your liver.\\n   As a source of carbohydrates for people with diabetes.

Hot peppers are distinguished from sweet\\n     peppers by their shape (they are longer and skinnier) and by their burning\\n     taste. Like bell peppers, jalapeños, chili peppers, and cayennes will turn\\n /   red as they ripen.                                                    Sweet peppers with the skin on have about one gram dietary fiber\\n     per  pepper  (insoluble  cellulose  and  lignin  in  the  peel,  soluble  pectins  in\\n     the flesh). Peppers have moderate to high amounts of vitamin A derived\\n     from yellow carotenes (including beta-carotene). The amount of vitamin\\n w   A  increases  as  the  pepper  ripens;  sweet  red  bell  peppers  have  nearly  10\\n     times as much vitamin A as green ones. Peppers are also a good source of\\n     vitamin C.\\n            Fresh peppers hold their nutrients well, even at room temperature.\\n ^   For example, green peppers stored at room temperature retained 85 per-\\n     cent of their vitamin C after 48 hours.\\n            Peppers  are  members  of  the  nightshade  family,  Solanacea.  Other\\n     members  of  this  family  are  eggplant,  potatoes,  tomatoes,  and  some\\n     mushrooms. Nightshade plants produce natural toxins called glycoalka-\\n ?   loids. The toxin in pepper is solanine. It is estimated that an adult would\\n     have to eat 4.5 pounds of peppers at one sitting to get a toxic amount of\\n     this glycoalkaloid.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

While the pineapple’s shell generally loses chlorophyll and turns\\nmore golden as the fruit ripens, some varieties of pineapple have more chlorophyll and stay\\ngreen longer than others, so the color of the shell is not a reliable guide to ripeness.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nStore  pineapples  either  at  room  temperature  or  in  the  refrigerator.  Neither  will  have  any\\neffect on the sweetness of the fruit. Fruits and vegetables get sweeter after they are picked\\nby converting stored starches to sugars. Since the pineapple has no stored starch and gets its\\nsugar from its leaves, it is as sweet as it ever will be on the day it is picked. It will get softer\\nwhile stored, though, as its pectic enzymes break down pectins in its cell walls.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nTo sweeten and soften fresh pineapple, peel and slice the fruit (or cut it into chunks), sprinkle\\nit with sugar, and chill it in the refrigerator. The sugar and water on the pineapple’s surface\\nis a denser solution than the liquid inside the pineapple’s cells. As a result liquid flows out\\nof the cells. Without liquid to hold them rigid, the cell walls will collapse inward and the\\npineapple will be softer. This physical phenomenon—the flow of liquids across a membrane\\nfrom a less dense to a more dense environment—is called osmosis.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nAs  you  cook  pineapple,  the  pectic  substances  in  its  cell  walls  dissolve  and  the  pineapple\\nsoftens.\\n        If  you  add  fresh  pineapple  to  gelatin,  the  bromelain  will  digest  the  proteins  in  the\\ngelatin and the dish won’t “set.” However, bromelain only works at a temperature between\\n140°F and 170°F; it is destroyed by boiling. For the maximum effect in stewing, set the heat\\nat simmer. To add fresh pineapple to a gelatin mold, boil the fruit first.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nDrying.      Drying concentrates the calories and nutrients in pineapple. Fresh pineapple may\\nbe treated with a sulfur compound such as sulfur dioxide to protect its vitamin C and keep\\nit from darkening as it dries.

If there\\nare any bone ends showing, they should be red, not white; the whiter the bone ends, the\\nolder the animal from which the meat was taken.\\nAvoid:     Packages with a lot of liquid. Meat that has lost moisture is likely to be dry and tough.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nRefrigerate  fresh  pork  immediately.  Refrigeration  prolongs  the  freshness  of  pork  by  slow-\\ning the natural multiplication of bacteria on the surface of meat. Left to their own devices,\\nthese bacteria convert proteins and other substances on the surface of the meat to a slimy\\nfilm and, eventually, they will convert the meat’s sulfur-containing amino acids methionine\\nand cystine into smelly chemicals called mercaptans. When the mercaptans combine with\\nmyoglobin,  they  produce  the  greenish  pigment  that  gives  spoiled  meat  its  characteristic\\nunpleasant appearance.\\n        Refrigeration slows this whole chain of events so that fresh roasts and chops usually\\nstay fresh for three to five days. For longer storage, store the pork in the freezer where the\\nvery low temperatures will slow the bacteria even more.\\n        Store unopened smoked or cured pork products in the refrigerator in the original wrap-\\nper and use according to the date and directions on the package.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nTrim  the  pork  carefully.  You  can  significantly  reduce  the  amount  of  fat  and  cholesterol  in\\neach serving by judiciously cutting away all visible fat.\\n        Do not add salt to the pork before you cook it; the salt will draw moisture out of the\\nmeat, making it stringy and tough. Add salt near the end of the cooking process.\\n        When you are done, clean all utensils thoroughly with soap and hot water. Wash your\\ncutting board, wood or plastic, with hot water, soap, and a bleach-and-water solution. For ulti-\\nmate safety in preventing the transfer of microorganisms from meat to other foods, keep one\\ncutting board exclusively for raw meat, fish, or poultry, and a second one for everything else.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nCooking changes the way pork looks and tastes, alters its nutritional value, makes it safer,\\nand extends its shelf life.\\n        Browning meat before you cook it does not seal in the juices, but it does change the\\nflavor by caramelizing proteins and sugars on the surface.

Browning has one minor nutritional\\ndrawback. It breaks amino acids on the surface of the meat into smaller compounds that are\\nno longer useful proteins.\\n        When  pork  is  heated,  it  loses  water  and  shrinks.  Its  pigments,  which  combine  with\\noxygen, are denatured (broken into smaller fragments) by the heat and turn brown, the natu-\\nral color of cooked meat. This color change is more dramatic in beef (which starts out red)\\nthan in pork (which starts out gray pink). In fact, you can pretty much judge beef’s doneness\\nfrom its color, but you must use a meat thermometer to measure the internal temperature of\\nthe meat before you can say it is thoroughly cooked.\\n        Pork is considered done (and safe to eat) when it reaches an average uniform internal tem-\\nperature of 170°F, hot enough to kill Trichinella spiralis, the organism that causes trichinosis.*\\n        Killing these organisms is one obvious benefit of heating pork thoroughly. Another is\\nthat heat liquifies the fat on the meat so that it simply runs off the meat. The unsaturated\\nfatty acids that remain in the meat, continue to oxidize as the meat cooks. Oxidized fats give\\ncooked  meat  a  characteristic  warmed-over  flavor.  You  can  reduce  the  warmed-over  flavor\\nby cooking and storing the meat under a blanket of catsup or a gravy made from tomatoes,\\npeppers, and other vitamin C–rich vegetables, all natural antioxidants that slow the oxida-\\ntion of the fats.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.      Freezing changes the flavor and texture of fresh pork. When fresh pork is frozen,\\nthe water in its cells turn into ice crystals that can tear the cell walls so that liquids leak out\\nwhen the pork is thawed. That’s why defrosted pork, like defrosted beef, veal, or lamb, may\\nbe drier and less tender than fresh meat.\\nCuring, smoking, and aging.               Curing preserves meat by osmotic action. The dry salt or a salt\\nsolution draws liquid out the cells of the meat and the cells of any microorganisms living\\non the meat.   Smoking—hanging meat over an open fire—gives meat a rich, “smoky” flavor\\n\\n*    Cooking pork in a microwave oven requires careful attention to the temperature. In 1982, researchers\\n    at Iowa State University found live trichinae in nine of 51 experimentally infected samples of pork that\\n    had been cooked in different brands and models of microwave ovens according to directions from the\\n    manufacturers and from the Pork Producers Council. In each case, while the internal temperature of\\n    the meat rose to 170°F, moisture evaporating on the surface of the meat kept the temperature there too\\n    low to kill the trichinae. In a second study, in 1983, the researchers recommended that pork cooked in\\n    a microwave oven be cooked in a special transparent plastic cooking bag to prevent the evaporation of\\n    moisture on the surface of the meat. Subsequent laboratory tests at Iowa showed that pork roasts micro-\\n    waved in these bags reached temperatures high enough to kill trichinae on all surfaces of the meat.\\n     Osmosis is the physical phenomenon by which liquids flow across a membrane, like a cell wall, from a\\n    less dense to a more dense environment. Since salt or salty liquid is denser than the liquid inside cells,\\n    it pulls out moisture.

Aging—letting  the  meat  hang  exposed  to\\n air—further reduces the moisture content and shrinks the meat.\\n Irradiation.     Irradiation  makes  meat safer  by  exposing  it  to  gamma  rays,  high-energy  ion-\\n izing radiation, the kind of radiation that kills living cells including potentially hazardous\\n microorganisms. The process does not change the way meat looks, feels, or tastes, nor does\\n it make the food radioactive. But it does change the structure of some naturally occurring\\n chemicals  in  meat,  breaking  molecules  apart  to  form  new  compounds  called  “radiolytic\\n products” (abbreviated as RP). About 90 percent of these compounds are also found in non-\\n irradiated foods. The rest, called “unique radiolytic products” (URP), are found only in irradi-\\n ated foods (including meat). In 1985, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of\\n low doses of radiation to kill Trichinella spiralis, the organism in pork that causes trichinosis.\\n Today,  irradiation  is  an  approved  technique  in  more  than  37  countries  around  the  world,\\n including the United States.

When you peel and slice pota-\\ntoes, throw out any that have rot or mold inside.\\n        Don’t peel or slice potatoes until you are ready to use them. When you cut into a potato\\nand tear its cell walls you release polyphenoloxidase, an enzyme that hastens the oxidation\\nof phenols in the potato, creating the brownish compounds that darken a fresh-cut potato.\\nYou  can  slow  this  reaction  (but  not  stop  it  completely)  by  soaking  the  peeled  sliced  fresh\\npotatoes in ice water, but many of the vitamins in the potatoes will leach out into the soak-\\ning water. Another alternative is to dip the sliced potatoes in an acid solution (lemon juice\\nand water, vinegar and water), but this will alter the taste.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nStarch consists of granules packed with the molecules of amylose and amylopectin. When\\nyou cook a potato, its starch granules absorb water molecules that cling to the amylose and\\namylopectin  molecules,  making  the  granules  swell.  If  the  granules  absorb  enough  water,\\nthey  will  rupture,  releasing  the  nutrients  inside.  If  you  are  cooking  potatoes  in  a  stew  or\\nsoup, the amylose and amylopectin molecules that escape from the ruptured starch granule\\nwill attract and hold water molecules in the liquid, thickening the dish.\\n        However you prepare them, cooked potatoes have more nutrients available than raw\\npotatoes do. They may also be a different color. Like onions and cauliflower, potatoes con-\\ntain pale anthoxanthin pigments that react with metal ions to form blue, green, or brown\\ncompounds. That’s why potatoes may turn yellowish if you cook them in an aluminum or\\niron pot or slice them with a carbon-steel knife. To keep potatoes pale, cook them in a glass\\nor enameled pot.\\n        See Adverse Effects Associated with This Food.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.      A  potato’s  cells  are  like  a  box  whose  stiff  walls  are  held  rigidly  in  place  by  the\\nwater inside the cell. When you freeze a cooked potato, the water in its cells forms ice crys-\\ntals that can tear the cell walls, allowing liquid to leak out when the potatoes are defrosted,\\nwhich  is  why  defrosted  potatoes  taste  mushy.  Commercial  processors  get  around  this  by\\npartially dehydrating potatoes before they are frozen or by freezing potatoes in a sauce that\\ngives an interesting flavor to take your mind off the texture.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Potato  “flakes”  and  “granules”  have  fewer  vitamins  and  minerals  than  fresh\\npotatoes; potato chips and sticks are usually much higher in salt.\\nPotato  salad.      Commercially  prepared  potato  salads  may  be  treated  with  a  sulfite  such  as\\nsulfur dioxide to inactivate polyphenoloxidase and keep the potatoes from darkening. People\\nwho are sensitive to sulfites may suffer serious allergic reactions, including potentially fatal\\nanaphylactic shock if they eat potato salads treated with these chemicals.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nTo soothe a skin rash.         Potato starch, like corn starch, may be used as a dusting powder or\\nadded  to  a  lukewarm  bath  to  soothe  a  wet,  “weepy”  skin  rash.

A  2004  study  from  Stockholm  University  (Sweden)  shows  that\\nexposing high-carbohydrate foods such as potatoes and grains to very high cooking temps\\ntriggers the production of odorless white crystals of acrylamide, a chemical the U.S. Envi-\\nronmental Protection Agency calls a “probable human carcinogen” in food. Currently, there\\nis  no  evidence  that  the  amount  of  acrylamide  in  potato  chips  and  bread  poses  a  serious\\nthreat to human health. However, in 2008, a report in the Journal of the Science of Food and\\nAgriculture  explained  that  (1)  washing  raw  potatoes,  or  (2)  soaking  them  in  water  for  30\\nminutes, or (3) soaking them in water for two hours reduced the formation of acrylamide\\nby 23 percent, 38 percent, and 48 percent respectively, so long as the potatoes were then\\nfried only to a light gold.\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\n* * *', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Beef and pork may have a few hundred bacteria\\nper square centimeter; chicken will have several thousand.\\n        Discard any poultry that feels slimy to the touch. If you are preparing duck or goose,\\npull as much fat out of the abdominal cavity as possible. To cut down on the fat in chicken,\\nremove the skin before cooking.\\n        To prevent poultry-borne illness:\\n\\n       1.   Keep  raw  chicken  cold,  frozen  chicken  frozen  solid,  and  leftover  cooked\\n            chicken in the refrigerator. Use fresh chicken within one or two days.\\n       2.   Keep  cutting  boards  and  utensils  clean  by  washing  in  hot  soapy  water  to\\n            prevent any cross contamination between raw poultry (or its juices) and other\\n            foods.\\n       3.   Cook poultry thoroughly to an internal temperature of 180°F (no guessing—\\n            use a meat thermometer).\\n\\nFresh chicken stays fresh one to two days in the fridge; plain cooked chicken, three to four\\ndays; chicken in gravy, two days.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nCooking changes the way poultry looks and tastes, alters its nutritional content, and makes\\nit safer to eat.\\n        Heat changes the structure of the poultry’s proteins. It denatures the protein molecules\\nso that they break apart into smaller fragments or change shape or clump together. These\\nchanges force moisture out of the tissues so that the poultry turns opaque as it cooks. As\\nit loses water, the poultry also loses water-soluble B vitamins, which drip out into the pan.\\nSince they are not destroyed by heat, they can be saved by using the skimmed pan drippings\\nfor gravy.

At the same time, the heat liquifies the fat\\nin the bird, which runs off into the pan, lowering the fat and cholesterol content.\\n        Finally, cooking kills the Salmonella and other microorganisms on the skin and flesh of\\npoultry. For maximum safety, poultry should be cooked to a uniform internal temperature of\\n180°F. If you are cooking your poultry in a microwave oven, check to be sure that the surface\\nof  the  bird—which  is  cooled  by  evaporating  moisture—is  as  hot  as  the  inside,  otherwise\\nbacteria on the skin may remain alive.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.     When poultry is frozen, the water in its cells turns into ice crystals which rupture\\nthe cell walls. When you thaw the poultry, liquid escapes from the cells and the chicken,\\nturkey, duck, or goose may taste dry and stringy.\\n        The unsaturated fatty acids in poultry will continue to oxidize (and eventually turn\\nrancid) while the bird is frozen. Poultry cut into pieces will spoil more quickly than a whole\\nbird because it has more surfaces exposed to the air. Fresh whole chicken and turkey will\\nkeep for up to 12 months at 0°F; chicken pieces will keep for nine months; turkey pieces and\\nwhole duck and goose for six months.\\nSmoking.       Smoking  (which  means  slowly  roasting  a  bird  in  the  smoke  from  an  open  fire)\\ngives poultry a rich taste that varies according to the wood used in the fire. Birds smoked\\nover an open fire may pick up carcinogenic chemicals from the smoke, including a-benzo-\\npyrene, the most prominent carcinogen in tobacco smoke. Artificial smoke flavoring is com-\\nmercially treated to remove tar and a-benzopyrene. Smoked poultry has less moisture and\\nproportionally more fat than fresh poultry.\\nSelf-basting”  turkeys.        To  make  these  birds  “self-basting,”  fat  or  oil  is  inserted  under  the\\nskin  of  the  breast  before  the  bird  is  packed  or  frozen.  As  the  bird  cooks,  the  fat  warms,\\nmelts, and oozes out, basting the turkey. “Self-basting” turkeys are higher in fat than other\\nturkeys; depending on what kind of fat is inserted into the breast, they may also be higher\\nin cholesterol.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nTo  relieve  the  congestion  of  a  cold.     Hot  chicken  soup,  the  quintessential  folk  remedy,  does\\nappear to relieve the congestion that comes with a head cold.

Brown  rice,  which  has  the  bran  (outer  seed\\n     covering), is high in fiber.\\n /          Rice’s proteins are plentiful but limited in the essential amino acids\\n     lysine and isoleucine. All rice is low in fat, but brown rice, with its fatty\\n     germ (the center of the seed), has about twice as much fat as white rice.\\n            Brown  rice  is  higher  in  vitamins  and  minerals  than  plain  milled\\n     white rice. Enriched white rice is equivalent to plain brown rice. All rice\\n w   is  a  source  of  B  vitamins,  including  folates.  In  1998,  FDA  ordered  food\\n     manufacturers to add folates—which protect against birth defects of the\\n     spinal cord and against heart disease—to flour, rice, and other grain prod-\\n     ucts. One year later, data from the Framingham Heart Study, which has\\n ^   followed heart health among residents of a Boston suburb for nearly half\\n     a century, showed a dramatic increase in blood levels of folic acid. Before\\n     the fortification of foods, 22 percent of the study participants had a folic\\n     acid deficiency; after, the number fell to 2 percent. Rice is also a source of\\n ?   calcium and nonheme iron, the form of iron found in plant foods.\\n     *                                                     Dry uncooked rice is low in sodium.

The proteins in rice are deficient in the essential amino acids\\nlysine  and  isoleucine  and  rich  in  the  essential  amino  acids  tryptophan,  methionine,  and\\ncystine. The proteins in legumes are exactly the opposite. Combining the two foods in one\\ndish “complements” or “completes” their proteins.\\n       With  meat  or  a  food  rich  in  vitamin  C  (tomatoes,  peppers).  Both  will  increase  the\\navailability of the iron in the rice. Meat increases the secretion of stomach acids (iron is\\nabsorbed better in an acid environment); vitamin C changes the iron in the rice from ferric\\niron (which is hard to absorb) to ferous iron (which is easier to absorb).\\n\\nDiets That May Restrict or Exclude This Food\\nLow-calcium diet (brown rice, wild rice)\\nLow-fiber diet\\n\\nBuying This Food\\nLook for:     Tightly sealed packages that protect the rice from air and moisture, which can\\noxidize the fats in the rice and turn them rancid.\\n       Choose the rice that meets your needs. Long-grain rice, which has less starch than short-\\ngrain (“Oriental”) rice, will be fluffier and less sticky when cooked. Brown rice has a distinctive\\nnutty taste that can overwhelm delicate foods or “fight” with other strong flavors.\\nAvoid:     Stained boxes of rice, even if they are still sealed.

White rice may stay fresh for as long as a year. Brown rice, which\\nretains its bran and germ and thus has more fats than white rice, may stay fresh for only a\\nfew months before its fats (inevitably) oxidize. All rice spoils more quickly in hot, humid\\nweather. Aging or rancid rice usually has a distinctive stale and musty odor.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nShould you wash rice before you cook it? Yes, if you are preparing imported rice or rice pur-\\nchased in bulk. No, if you are preparing prepacked white or brown rice.\\n        You wash all varieties of bulk rices to flush away debris and/or insects. You wash imported\\nrices to rinse off the cereal or corn-syrup coating. You should pick over brown and white rices to\\ncatch the occasional pebble or stone, but washing is either worthless or detrimental.\\n        Washing brown rice has no effect one way or the other. Since the grains are protected\\nby their bran, the water will not flush away either starches or nutrients. Washing long-grain\\nwhite rices, however, will rinse away some of the starch on the surface, which can be a plus\\nif you want the rice to be as fluffy as possible. The downside is that washing the rice will\\nalso rinse away any nutrients remaining on plain milled rice and dissolve the starch/nutrient\\ncoating on enriched rices. Washing the starches off short-grain, Oriental rices will make the\\nrice uncharacteristically dry rather than sticky.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nStarch consists of molecules of the complex carbohydrates amylose and amylopectin packed\\ninto a starch granule. When you cook rice, the starch granules absorb water molecules. When\\nthe  temperature  of  the  water  reaches  approximately  140°F,  the  amylose  and  amylopectin\\nmolecules inside the starch granules relax and unfold, breaking some of their internal bonds\\n(bonds between atoms on the same molecule) and forming new bonds between atoms on\\ndifferent molecules. The result is a starch network of starch molecules that traps and holds\\nwater molecules, making the starch granules even more bulky. In fact, rice holds so much\\nwater that it will double or even triple in bulk when cooked.*\\n        If you continue to cook the rice, the starch granules will eventually break open, the liq-\\nuid inside will leak out, the walls of the granules will collapse, and the rice will turn soft and\\nmushy. At the same time, amylose and amylopectin molecules escaping from the granules\\nwill make the outside of the rice sticky—the reason why overcooked rice clumps together.\\n        There are several ways to keep rice from clumping when you cook it. First, you can cook\\nthe rice in so much water that the grains have room to boil without bumping into each other,\\nbut  you  will  lose  B  vitamins  when  you  drain  the  excess  water  from  the  rice.  Second,  you\\ncan sauté the rice before you boil it or add a little fat to the boiling liquid. Theoretically, this\\n\\n*    Cooking rice in liquids other than water (tomato juice, bouillon, wine) keeps the rice firmer, since the\\n    grains will absorb solids along with water.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

But this method\\n raises  the  fat  content  of  the  rice—with  no  guarantee  that  it  will  really  keep  the  rice  from\\n clumping. The best method is to cook the rice in just as much water as it can absorb without\\n rupturing its starch granules and remove the rice from the heat as soon as the water is almost\\n all absorbed. Fluff the cooked rice with a fork as it is cooling, to separate the grains.\\n\\n How Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\n “Converted” rice.       “Converted” rice is rice that is parboiled under pressure before it is milled.\\nThis process drives the vitamins and minerals into the grain and loosens the bran so that it\\nslips off easily when the rice is milled. Converted rice retains more vitamins and minerals\\nthan conventionally milled white rice.\\n“Quick-cooking”  rice.         This  is  rice  that  has  been  cooked  and  dehydrated.  Its  hard,  starchy\\n outer  covering  and  its  starch  granules  have  already  been  broken  so  it  will  reabsorb  water\\n almost instantly when you cook it.\\n\\n Medical Uses and/or Benefits\\n To soothe irritated skin.      Like corn starch or potato starch, powdered rice used as a dusting pow-\\nder or stirred into the bath water may soothe and dry a “wet” skin rash. It is so drying, however,\\nthat it should never be used on a dry skin rash or on any rash without a doctor’s advice.\\n As a substitute for wheat flour in a gluten-free diet.           People with celiac disease have an inherited\\n metabolic disorder which makes it impossible for them to digest gluten and gliadin, proteins\\n found in wheat and some other grains. Rice and rice flour, which are free of gluten and glia-\\n din, may be a useful substitute in some recipes.\\n\\n Adverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n Beri-beri:     Beri-beri is the thiamin (vitamin B)-deficiency disease. Beri-beri, which is rare                     1\\n today,  occurs  among  people  for  whom  milled  white  rice,  stripped  of  its  B  vitamins,  is  a\\n dietary mainstay. Enriching the rice prevents beri-beri.\\n Mold  toxins.      Rice,  like  other  grains,  may  support  the  growth  of  toxic  molds,  including\\n Aspergillus flavus, which produces carcinogenic aflatoxins. Other toxins found on moldy rice\\n include citrinin, a penicillium mold too toxic to be used as an antibiotic; rubratoxins, mold\\n products known to cause hemorrhages in animals who eat the moldy rice; and nivalenol, a\\n mold toxin that suppresses DNA and protein synthesis in cells. Because mold may turn the\\n rice yellow, moldy rice is also known as yellow rice.\\n\\n Food/Drug Interactions\\n * * *', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

They do have comparable amounts of cholesterol, but this\\n    is offset by the fact that like other seafood, shellfish provide omega-3 fatty\\nw   acids, the class of heart-protective fats that includes linolenic acid, eicosa-\\n    pentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).\\n            Like other foods from animals, all shellfish are good sources of B vita-\\n    mins, heme iron (the organic form of iron most easily absorbed by the body),\\n^   and zinc.

Steam the conch or crack its shell. Open the shell and pull out the meat. Cut away\\n and discard the stomach (it’s right in the middle) and the dark tail. Peel off the skin, slice the\\n meat thin, and pound it to tenderize the meat. Rinse, pat dry, and cook.\\n Crabs.     To clean hard-shell crabs, cook them first. Then plunge the hot crabs into cold water to\\n firm up the meat. Remove the tail, snap off the claws, and pull off the shell. Cut away the gills\\n and the digestive organs in the middle of the body and pull the meat away from the skeleton.\\n Soft-shell crabs should be washed in cold water. They are ready to cook when you buy them.\\n Lobsters  and  crayfish  (live).      If you plan to boil the lobsters, you can cook them just as they\\ncome from the store. If you plan to broil a lobster, kill it first by inserting a knife into the space\\nbetween the head and the body and slicing through the crustacean’s spinal cord. Then split the\\nlobster and remove the internal organs. Live crayfish that have been stored in fresh running\\nwater do not have to be eviscerated before you boil them. If you wish to eviscerate the crayfish,\\ngrasp the middle fin on the tail, twist, and pull hard to pull out the stomach and intestine.\\nMussels.       In the shell, mussels, like clams, are apt to be sandy. To get rid of the grit, scrub the\\nmussels under cold running water, then put them in a pot of cold water and let them stand for\\nan hour or two. Discard any that float to the top. Rinse the rest once more under cold running\\nwater, trim the “beard” with scissors, and prepare as your recipe directs.\\nOysters.      Unlike clams and mussels, oysters in the shell are free of sand when you buy them.\\n To prepare them, just wash the oysters thoroughly under cold running water. Discard any\\n that don’t close tight when you touch them or that float in water. Cook them in the shell or\\n pry open the shell, strain the liquid for any stray grit, and use the oysters with or without\\n the shell, as you recipe directs.\\n Scallops.     Shelled scallops in bulk should be relatively free of liquid. Rinse them in cold run-\\n ning water and use as your recipe directs.\\n Shrimp and prawns.           Wash the shrimp or prawns in cold running water. Then cook them in\\n the shell to enhance the flavor of a soup or stew, or peel off the shell and remove the black\\n “vein” (actually the digestive tract) running down the back, and prepare the shellfish as your\\n recipe directs. (The orange line sometimes found running alongside the “vein” is edible roe.)\\n Snails (canned).        Prepare as your recipe directs.\\n         When you are done, clean all utensils thoroughly with soap and hot water.

For\\nultimate  safety  in  preventing  the  transfer  of  microorganisms  from  the  shellfish  to  other\\nfoods,  keep  one  cutting  board  exclusively  for  fish,  meat,  or  poultry,  and  a  second  one  for\\neverything else.\\n\\n What Happens When You Cook This Food\\n When you cook shellfish, heat changes the structure of its proteins.

The loss of moisture also changes the texture of the shellfish; the longer they are\\ncooked, the more rubbery they will become. Shellfish should be cooked long enough to turn\\nthe flesh opaque and destroy any microorganisms living on the food.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.      When you freeze shellfish, the water in their cells forms ice crystals that can tear\\nthe cell membranes so the liquids inside leak out when the shellfish is defrosted—which is\\nthe  reason  defrosted  shellfish  tastes  tougher  and  has  less  B  vitamins  than  fresh  shellfish.\\nDefrosting  the  shellfish  slowly  in  the  refrigerator,  lessens  the  loss  of  moisture  and  B  vita-\\nmins. Frozen shrimp and prawns can be boiled whole, in the shells, without defrosting.\\nCanning.       Virtually all canned shellfish is higher in sodium than fresh shellfish. To reduce\\nthe sodium content, rinse the shellfish in cold water before you use it.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nAs a source of calcium.          Ground oyster shells, which are rich in calcium carbonate, are the\\ncalcium  source  in  many  over-the-counter  supplements.  Calcium  carbonate  is  an  efficient\\nsource of the mineral, but it is also likely to cause constipation.\\nProtective effects of omega-3 fatty acids.            Shellfish have small amounts of omega-3 fatty acids,\\na  family  of  fatty  acids  which  includes  the  essential  fatty  acid  linolenic  acid.  Two  other\\nomega-3s, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), most abundant in\\nfish living in cold waters, are the primary unsaturated fatty acids in oils from fish (anchovy,\\nherring, mackerel, menhaden, salmon, sardines, trout, tuna) and shellfish, as well as human\\nbreast milk.\\n        The omega-3s appear to reduce the risk of heart attack and “sudden death.” A 20-year\\nproject at the University of Leyden in the Netherlands, comparing the eating habits of more\\nthan 800 men at risk of heart disease, found that men who ate more than an ounce of fish a\\nday had a 50 percent lower rate of heart attacks. Since then, a lengthening list of studies has\\nshown similar protection among men who eat fish at least two or three times a week. Pos-\\nsible explanations for this effect are the omega-3s ability to lower the levels of tryglycerides\\nin  your  blood  (high  triglycerides  are  a  risk  factor  for  heart  disease)  and  the  fact  that  your\\nbody converts omega-3s to a compound similar to prostacyclin, a naturally occurring chemi-\\ncal that inhibits the formation of blood clots.\\n        In the United States, about 250,000 people die each year from sudden cardiac failure\\ncaused by ventricular fibrillation, an unexpectedly irregular heartbeat. Those most at risk are\\npeople with blocked arteries (atherosclerosis), congestive heart failure, or abnormal thicken-\\ning of the heart muscle. In a 1995 study from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and\\nIndustrial Research Organization (Adelaide), laboratory monkeys fed omega-3 oils from fish\\nhad a steady heartbeat when exposed to electrical current twice as powerful as that which\\ncaused  ventricular  fibrillation  in  animals  that  did  not  get  the  fish  oils.

(See below.)\\n        Omega-3s  also  inhibit  the  production  of  leuketrienes,  naturally  occurring  chemicals\\nthat  trigger  inflammation.  This  may  be  beneficial  to  people  with  rheumatoid  arthritis.  In\\n1995, the Arthritis Foundation published the results of a study by Piet Geusens at the Catho-\\nlic University in Pellenberg (Belgium) suggesting that patients who take omega-3 fatty acid\\nsupplements along with their regular arthritis medications have improved pain relief. Previ-\\nous studies had demonstrated the omega-3s ability to reduce inflammation, joint stiffness\\nand swelling.\\n        Finally, omega-3s may protect bone density. A 1997 study at Purdue University (Indi-\\nana) demonstrated that animals fed increased amounts of the omega-3 fatty acids formed\\nnew  bone  faster  than  animals  fed  a  regular  diet.  This  result  has  also  shown  up  in  studies\\nwith soybeans .\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nAllergic reaction.      According to the Merck Manual, shellfish are one of the 12 foods most likely\\nto trigger classic food allergy symptoms: hives, swelling of the lips and eyes, and upset stom-\\nach. The others are berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries), chocolate,\\ncorn, eggs, fish, legumes (green peas, lima beans, peanuts, soybeans), milk, nuts, peaches,\\npork, and wheat (see wheatcereals). NOTE: Shrimp treated with sulfur compounds to pre-\\nvent their darkening can cause serious allergic reactions in people sensitive to sulfites.\\nFood-borne  infectious  diseases.          In  the  past  two  decades,  food  scientists  have  identified  an\\nincreasing  number  of  bacteria  and  viruses,  including  the  cholera  organism,  the  hepatitis\\nvirus, and Vibrio vulnificus, in live shellfish. According to the Food and Drug Administration,\\nVibrio  cholera  organisms  introduced  when  wastes  are  thrown  into  the  ocean  are  now  per-\\nmanent residents along some parts of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, found all the way from\\nMaine  to  Texas.  Cholera-contaminated  shrimp  and  crabs  have  been  found  in  Louisiana,\\ncontaminated blue crabs in Galveston, (Texas), and contaminated oysters in Florida. Shell-\\nfish from infected water may carry the hepatitis B virus; Vibrio vulnificus, another organism\\ncarried in shellfish, causes fever, chills, and shock.\\n        While it is true that cooking kills these organisms, the Centers for Disease Control—\\nwhich advises cooking ALL shellfish—warns that viruses can survive quick steaming. The\\nCDC further warns that raw shellfish are particularly hazardous for people with a weakened\\nimmune  system:  the  very  young,  the  very  old,  those  who  are  HIV-positive  or  undergoing\\ncancer chemotherapy or have liver disease, diabetes, or chronic gastrointestinal disease.\\n“Red  Tide”  poisoning.         “Red  tide”  is  a  blanket  of  reddish  organisms  called  dinoflagellates\\nthat float on the surface of the coastal waters of the Pacific and New England coasts between\\nJuly  and  October.  The  dinoflagellates  produce  a  neurological  toxin  that  can  be  carried  by\\nany  shellfish  (clams,  mussels,  oysters)  that  eat  the  plankton.

Meat makes your stomach more acid (iron is absorbed more easily in an acid\\nenvironment); vitamin C may convert the iron in soybeans from ferric iron (which is hard to\\nabsorb) to ferrous iron (which is easier to absorb).\\n\\nDiets That May Restrict or Exclude This Food\\nLow-calcium diet\\nLow-fiber diet\\nLow-protein diet\\nLow-purine (antigout) diet\\n\\nBuying This Food\\nLook for:     Tightly sealed packages that protect the beans from air and moisture. The beans\\nshould be smooth-skinned, uniformly sized, evenly colored, and free of stones and debris. It\\nis easy to check beans sold in plastic bags, but the transparent material lets in light that may\\ndestroy pyridoxine and pyridoxal, the natural forms of vitamin B12 .\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nStore beans in air- and moistureproof containers in a cool, dark cabinet where they are pro-\\ntected from heat, light, and insects.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nWash the beans and pick them over carefully, discarding damaged beans, withered beans, or\\nbeans that float.

In discarding this liquid you are getting rid of some of the soluble indigestible sugars\\n that may cause intestinal gas when you eat beans.\\n\\n What Happens When You Cook This Food\\n When soybeans are cooked in liquid, their cells absorb water, swell, and eventually rupture,\\n releasing  pectins,  gums,  and  the  nutrients  inside  the  cell.  In  addition,  cooking  destroys\\n antinutrients in beans, making them safe to eat.\\n\\n How Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\n Tofu.    Tofu  is  a  bland  white  cheeselike  food  made  of  liquid  squeezed  from  soybeans  and\\n stiffened with a firming agent such as gluconolactone, calcium chloride, or calcium sulfate.\\n        Heating  tofu  evaporates  moisture  and  further  coagulates  proteins,  making  the  tofu\\n firmer  and  more  dense.  Tofu  can  be  frozen;  defrosted  tofu  is  caramel-colored  rather  than\\n creamy white with a spongy texture that soaks up sauce and flavorings.\\n        Tofu  is  a  useful  cholesterol-free  vegetarian  substitute  for  meat,  fish,  or  poultry.  One\\n 3-ounce serving of tofu equals one meat serving on the USDA/Health and Human Services\\n Food Guide Pyramid. One four-ounce serving of regular tofu has one gram dietary fiber, six\\n grams fat (0.9 g saturated fat), 10 g protein, 130 mg calcium, and 70 mg isoflavones.\\n Soy milk.     Soy milk is a blend of soy flour (ground soybeans) and water. It is not a natural\\n source of calcium, but most commercial soy milks are calcium-fortified, a useful alternative\\n for  people  who  cannot  eat  dairy  foods.  One  cup  calcium-fortified  soy  milk  may  have  as\\n much as 300 mg calcium.\\n Soy sauce.      Soy sauce is made by adding salt to cooked soybeans and setting the mixture\\naside to ferment. Soy sauce is high in sodium, and it may interact with monoamine oxi-\\ndase (MAO) inhibitors, antidepressant drugs that inactivate naturally occurring enzymes\\nin your body that metabolize tyramine, a substance found in many fermented foods such\\nas soy sauces. Tyramine is a pressor amine; it constricts blood vessels and increases blood\\npressure. If you eat a food containing tyramine while you are taking an MAO inhibitor,\\nyou  cannot  effectively  eliminate  the  tyramine  from  your  body,  and  the  result  may  be  a\\nhypertensive crisis.\\nMilling.     Soy flour is a powder made from soybeans. It is high in protein (37–47 percent). It can\\n be used as a substitute for up to 20 percent of the wheat flour in any recipe. Unlike wheat flour,\\n it has no gluten or gliadin, which makes it useful for people who have celiac disease, a meta-\\n bolic disorder that makes it impossible for them to digest these wheat proteins (see flour).\\n Canning.      The  heat  of  canning  destroys  some  of  the  B  vitamins  in  soybeans.  Since  the  B\\n vitamins are water-soluble, you could save them by using the liquid in the can. But the liquid\\n also contains the indigestible sugars that cause intestinal gas when you eat beans.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Preprocessed dried soybeans have already been soaked. They take less time\\nto cook, but they are lower in B vitamins.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nLower risk of some birth defects.           Up to two of every 1,000 babies born in the United States\\neach year may have cleft palate or a neural tube (spinal cord) defect due to their mothers’\\nnot having gotten adequate amounts of folate during pregnancy. The current RDA for folate\\nis 180 mcg for a woman and 200 mcg for a man, but the FDA now recommends 400 mcg\\nfor a woman who is or may become pregnant. Taking a folate supplement before becoming\\npregnant and continuing through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the risk of cleft\\npalate; taking folate through the entire pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\\nPossible lower risk of heart attack.          In the spring of 1998, an analysis of data from the records\\nfor more than 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses’ Health Study at Harvard\\nSchool of Public Health/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, demonstrated that a diet\\nproviding more than 400 mcg folate and 3 mg vitamin B 6 daily, either from food or supple-\\nments,  might  reduce  a  woman’s  risk  of  heart  attack  by  almost  50  percent.  Although  men\\nwere not included in the study, the results were assumed to apply to them as well.\\n        However,  data  from  a  meta-analysis  published  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical\\nAssociation in December 2006 called this theory into question. Researchers at Tulane Univer-\\nsity examined the results of 12 controlled studies in which 16,958 patients with preexisting\\ncardiovascular disease were given either folic acid supplements or placebos (“look-alike” pills\\nwith no folic acid) for at least six months. The scientists, who found no reduction in the risk\\nof further heart disease or overall death rates among those taking folic acid, concluded that\\nfurther studies will be required to ascertain whether taking folic acid supplements reduces\\nthe risk of cardiovascular disease.\\nLower cholesterol levels.        A 1997 meta-analysis of 38 studies with more than 730 volunteers\\nby James Anderson of the Metabolic Research Group at the Veterans Administration Medical\\nCenter and the University of Kentucky in Lexington demonstrates that substituting soy pro-\\ntein for animal proteins can lead to an average 9.3 percent decline in total cholesterol, a 12.3\\npercent decline in levels of low-density lipoproteins (the fat and protein particles that carry\\ncholesterol into your arteries), and a 2.4 percent rise in HDL levels. People whose original\\ncholesterol readings are “high” (250–289 mg/dl) are likely to see a greater decrease, as much\\nas 24 percent lower total cholesterol.\\n        There are currently two theories to explain how beans reduce cholesterol levels. The\\nfirst theory is that the pectins in the beans may form a gel in your stomach that sops up fats\\nand keeps them from being absorbed by your body. The second is that bacteria in the gut may\\nfeed on the bean fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids that inhibit the production of choles-\\nterol in your liver. Whether soy’s isoflavones affect cholesterol levels remains unanswered.\\nLower  levels  of  homocysteine.         Homocysteine  is  an  amino  acid  produced  during  the  diges-\\ntion  of  proteins.

Substituting soybeans for\\n high-protein foods from animals lowers homocysteine production.\\n Protective effects of omega-3 fatty acids.          Omega-3s appear to reduce the risk of heart attack. A\\n20-year project at the University of Leyden in the Netherlands, comparing the eating habits\\nof more than 800 men at risk of heart disease, found that men who ate more than an ounce\\nof fish a day had a 50 percent lower rate of heart attacks. Since then, a lengthening list of\\nstudies has shown similar protection among men who eat fish at least two or three times a\\nweek. One possible explanation is that omega-3s reduce triglyceride levels. Another is that\\nyour body converts omega-3s to a compound similar to prostacyclin, a naturally occurring\\nchemical that inhibits the formation of blood clots.\\n        Omega-3s also reduce the risk of “sudden death” heart attack. In the United States,\\nabout 250,000 people die each year from sudden cardiac failure caused by ventricular fibril-\\nlation,  an  unexpectedly  irregular  heartbeat.  A  1995  study  from  the  Australian  Common-\\nwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (Adelaide), showed that laboratory\\nmonkeys  fed  omega-3  oils  from  fish  had  a  steady  heartbeat  when  exposed  to  electrical\\ncurrent twice as powerful as that which caused ventricular fibrillation in animals that did\\nnot get the fish oils.\\n        Omega-3s  inhibit  the  production  of  leuketrienes,  naturally  occurring  chemicals  that\\ntrigger inflammation. This may be beneficial to people with rheumatoid arthritis. In 1995,\\nthe  Arthritis  Foundation  published  the  results  of  a  study  by  Piet  Geusens  at  the  Catholic\\nUniversity  in  Pellenberg  (Belgium)  suggesting  that  patients  who  take  omega-3  fatty  acid\\nsupplements along with their regular arthritis medications have improved pain relief. Previ-\\nous studies had demonstrated the omega-3s ability to reduce inflammation, joint stiffness\\nand swelling.\\n        Like isoflavones (see below), omega-3s may protect bone density. One 1997 study at\\nPurdue University (Indiana) demonstrated that animals fed increased amounts of the omega-\\n3 fatty acids formed new bone faster than animals fed a regular diet.\\nPotential  protective  effects  of  isoflavones.         Soybeans  are  the  most  prominent  source  of  iso-\\n flavones, plant compounds that mimic the effect of estrogen. The isoflavones in soybeans,\\n genistein  and  daidzein,  appear  to  protect  bone  density,  and  in  the  January  2008  issue  of\\n Menopause researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston) report that a daid-\\n zein supplement may reduce the severity of menopausal hot flashes. However, earlier claims\\n that  consuming  soy  isoflavones  might  protect  against  breast,  ovarian,  and  uterine  cancers\\n have not been proven.\\n As  a  source  of  carbohydrates  for  people  with  diabetes.           Beans  are  digested  very  slowly,  pro-\\nducing only a gradual rise in blood-sugar levels. As a result, the body needs less insulin to\\ncontrol blood sugar after eating beans than after eating some other high-carbohydrate foods\\n(bread or potato). In studies at the University of Kentucky, a bean, whole-grain, vegetable,\\nand fruit-rich diet developed at the University of Toronto and recommended by the Ameri-\\ncan  Diabetes  Association  enabled  patients  with  type  1  diabetes  (who  do  not  produce  any', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

For patients with type 2\\n   diabetes (who can produce some insulin) the bean diet reduced the need for injected insulin\\n   by 98 percent.

Although beans are high in calories, they are also high in fiber; even a small\\n   serving can make you feel full. And, because they are insulin-sparing, they put off the rise in\\n   insulin levels that makes us feel hungry again soon after eating. Research at the University of\\n   Toronto suggests the insulin-sparing effect may last for several hours after you eat the beans,\\n   perhaps until after your next meal.\\n\\n   Adverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n   Allergic reaction.       According to the Merck Manual, legumes, including soybeans, are one of\\n   the 12 foods most likely to trigger classic food allergy symptoms: hives, swelling of the lips\\n   and eyes, and upset stomach. The others are berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries,\\n   strawberries), chocolate, corn, eggs, fish, milk, nuts, peaches, pork, shellfish, and wheat (see\\n              cereals).\\n   wheat\\n\\n   Intestinal gas.      Soybeans contain raffinose and stachyose, complex sugars that human beings\\n   cannot  digest.  The  sugars  sit  in  the  gut,  where  they  are  fermented  by  intestinal  bacteria,\\n   which then produce gas that distends the intestines and makes us uncomfortable. You can\\n   lessen this effect by covering the beans with boiling water and soaking them for four to six\\n   hours before you cook them so that the indigestible sugars leach out into the soaking water,\\n   which  can  be  discarded.  Or  you  may  soak  the  beans  for  four  hours  in  nine  cups  of  water\\n   for every cup of beans, discard the soaking water, and add new water as your recipe directs.\\n   Then cook the beans and drain them before serving.\\n   Production of uric acid.        Purines are the natural metabolic by-products of protein metabolism\\n   in the body. They eventually break down into uric acid, which forms sharp crystals that may\\n   concentrate in joints, a condition known as gout. If uric acid crystals collect in the urine, the\\n   result may be kidney stones. Eating dried beans, which are rich in proteins, may raise the\\n   concentration of purines in your body. Although controlling the amount of purines in the\\n   diet does not significantly affect the course of gout (which is treated with allopurinol, a drug\\n   that prevents the formation of uric acid crystals), limiting these foods is still part of many\\n   gout regimens.\\n\\n   Food/Drug Interactions\\n   * * *', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Another alternative is to cook the spinach with the\\nlid off the pot so the volatile acids can float off into the air. Or you can steam the spinach\\nquickly in very little water so that it retains its vitamin C and cooks before there is time\\nfor the chlorophyll/acid reaction to occur.\\n        Spinach also contains astringent tannins that react with metals to create dark pig-\\nments.

Canned spinach, which is processed at high heat, is olive or bronze\\nrather  than  green.  Like  cooked  spinach,  canned  spinach  and  frozen  spinach  have  only  50\\npercent of the vitamin C in fresh spinach.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nReduced  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease,  cancer,  decline  of  brain  function,  and  other  diseases  of\\naging.     Antioxidants prevent free radicals, fragments of molecules, from hooking up with\\nother fragments to produce compounds that damage body cells, thus lowering your risk of\\nheart disease, cancer, memory loss, and other conditions associated with aging or damaged\\ncells.  In  1996,  researchers  at  the  USDA  Jean  Mayer  Human  Nutrition  Research  Center  on\\nAging at Tufts University (Boston) showed that, ounce for ounce, strawberries, blueberries,\\nand spinach were the most potentially potent antioxidants of 40 foods tested. While blue-\\nberries scored number one in the Tufts study, antioxidant ranking of these foods may vary\\ndepending on growing conditions, season, and other variables.\\nLower risk of some birth defects.           As many as two of every 1,000 babies born in the United\\nStates each year may have cleft palate or a neural tube (spinal cord) defect due to their moth-\\ner’s  not  having  gotten  adequate  amounts  of  folate  during  pregnancy.  The  current  RDA  for\\nfolate is 180 mcg for a woman and 200 mcg for a man, but the FDA now recommends 400 mcg\\nfor a woman who is or may become pregnant. Taking folate supplements before becoming\\npregnant and continuing through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the risk of cleft\\npalate; taking folate through the entire pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\\nPossible lower risk of heart attack.          In the spring of 1998, an analysis of data from the records\\nfor more than 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses’ Health Study at Harvard\\nSchool of Public Health/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, demonstrated that a diet\\nproviding more than 400 mcg folate and 3 mg vitamin B 6 daily, either from food or supple-\\nments,  might  reduce  a  woman’s  risk  of  heart  attack  by  almost  50  percent.  Although  men\\nwere not included in the study, the results were assumed to apply to them as well.\\n        However,  data  from  a  meta-analysis  published  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical\\nAssociation in December 2006 called this theory into question. Researchers at Tulane Univer-\\nsity examined the results of 12 controlled studies in which 16,958 patients with preexisting\\ncardiovascular disease were given either folic acid supplements or placebos (“look-alike” pills\\nwith no folic acid) for at least six months. The scientists, who found no reduction in the risk\\nof further heart disease or overall death rates among those taking folic acid, concluded that\\nfurther studies will be required to ascertain whether taking folic acid supplements reduces\\nthe risk of cardiovascular disease.\\nLower  risk  of  stroke.       Various  nutrition  studies  have  attested  to  the  power  of  adequate\\npotassium to keep blood pressure within safe levels.

Spinach,  like  beets,  celery,  eggplant,  lettuce,  radish,  and  collard\\nand turnip greens, contains nitrates that convert naturally into nitrites in your stomach and\\nthen  react  with  the  amino  acids  in  proteins  to  form  nitrosamines.  Although  some  nitro-\\nsamines  are  known  or  suspected  carcinogens,  this  natural  chemical  conversion  presents\\nno  known  problems  for  a  healthy  adult.  However,  when  these  nitrate-rich  vegetables  are\\ncooked and left to stand at room temperature, bacterial enzyme action (and perhaps some\\nenzymes in the plants) converts the nitrates to nitrites at a much faster rate than normal.\\nThese higher-nitrite foods may be hazardous for infants; several cases of “spinach poison-\\ning” been reported among children who ate cooked spinach that had been left standing at\\nroom temperature.\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\nAnticoagulants        Spinach  is  rich  in  vitamin  K,  the  blood-clotting  vitamin  produced  natu-\\nrally by bacteria in the intestines. Consuming large quantities of this food may reduce the\\neffectiveness of anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin (Coumadin). One cup of\\ndrained canned spinach contains 988 mcg vitamin K, 16 times the RDA for a healthy adult;\\none cup of shredded raw spinach contains 144 mcg vitamin K, nearly three times the RDA\\nfor a healthy adult.\\nMAO inhibitors.         Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are drugs used as antidepressants\\nor antihypertensives. They interfere with the action of enzymes that break down tyramine,\\na  chemical  produced  when  long-chain  protein  molecules  are  broken  into  smaller  pieces.\\nTyramine is a pressor amine, a chemical that constricts blood vessels and raises blood pres-\\nsure. If you eat a food rich in tyramine while you are taking an MAO inhibitor, the pressor\\namine  cannot  be  eliminated  from  your  body  and  the  result  may  be  a  hypertensive  crisis\\n(sustained elevated blood pressure).

The  proteins  are\\ndenatured, which means that they break into smaller fragments or change shape or clump\\ntogether. These changes cause protein tissues to lose moisture and shrink, so that the sea-\\nfood becomes opaque as it cooks.\\n        Squid cooks fairly quickly. Its thin-walled body can be fried or sautéed in less than a\\nminute and stewed in half an hour. Octopus, on the other hand, may need to be simmered\\nfor as long as three hours. But take care: the longer you cook the octopus, the more moisture\\nyou squeeze out of its protein tissues and the more rubbery it becomes.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.     Commercially processed squid are soaked in brine before freezing, which makes\\nthem much higher in sodium than fresh squid.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nProtective effects of omega-3 fatty acids.           Omega-3s appear to reduce the risk of heart attack.\\nA  20-year  project  at  the  University  of  Leyden  in  the  Netherlands,  comparing  the  eating\\nhabits of more than 800 men at risk of heart disease, found that men who ate more than an\\nounce of fish a day had a 50 percent lower rate of heart attacks. Since then, a lengthening list\\nof studies has shown similar protection among men who eat fish at least two or three times\\na week. One possible explanation is that omega-3s reduce triglyceride levels. Another is that\\nyour body converts omega-3s to a compound similar to prostacyclin, a naturally occurring\\nchemical that inhibits the formation of blood clots.\\n        Omega-3s also reduce the risk of “sudden death” heart attack. In the United States,\\nabout 250,000 people die each year from sudden cardiac failure caused by ventricular fibril-\\nlation,  an  unexpectedly  irregular  heartbeat.  A  1995  study  from  the  Australian  Common-\\nwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (Adelaide), showed that laboratory\\nmonkeys  fed  omega-3  oils  from  fish  had  a  steady  heartbeat  when  exposed  to  electrical\\ncurrent twice as powerful as that which caused ventricular fibrillation in animals that did\\nnot get the fish oils.\\n        Omega-3s  inhibit  the  production  of  leuketrienes,  naturally  occurring  chemicals  that\\ntrigger inflammation.

People  whose  blood-cholesterol  levels  are  abnormally\\nhigh are considered at risk for heart disease, but experts disagree as to the effects of dietary\\ncholesterol  on  serum  cholesterol.  Patients  with  hypercholesteremia,  a  metabolic  disorder\\nthat  influences  cholesterol  production  in  the  liver,  may  benefit  from  a  diet  low  in  dietary\\ncholesterol, but there is no conclusive proof that lowering a healthy person’s consumption of\\ndietary cholesterol will significantly change the amount of cholesterol he or she produces.

Adding sugar speeds up the process even further because some\\n   of  the  chemicals  produced  when  sugars  are  heated  also  break  down  anthocyanins.  That’s\\n   why  strawberries  cooked  in  boiling,  sugared  water  turn  brown  faster  than  strawberries\\n   steamed quickly without sugar.\\n          Red anthocyanins also change color in acids and bases (alkalis). They are bright red in\\n   acids such as lemon juice and bluish or purple in bases such as baking soda. If you cook straw-\\n   berries in an aluminum or iron pot, their acids will react with metal ions from the surface of\\n   the pot to create dark brown compounds that darken either the pot or the fruit.\\n          Strawberries also lose heat-sensitive vitamin C when you cook them.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

As noted above, strawberries\\nturn brown when you heat them with sugar. Lemon juice added to jams, jellies, and preserves\\nmakes the taste tart and helps preserve the color.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nLower risk of some birth defects.           Up to two of every 1,000 babies born in the United States\\neach year may have cleft palate or a neural tube (spinal cord) defect due to their mothers’\\nnot having gotten adequate amounts of folate during pregnancy. The current RDA for folate\\nis  180  mcg  for  a  woman  and  200  mcg  for  a  man,  but  FDA  now  recommends  400  mcg  for\\na  woman  who  is  or  may  become  pregnant.  Taking  a  folate  supplement  before  becoming\\npregnant and continuing through the first two months of pregnancy reduces the risk of cleft\\npalate; taking folate through the entire pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects.\\nPossible lower risk of heart attack.          In the spring of 1998, an analysis of data from the records\\nfor more than 80,000 women enrolled in the long-running Nurses’ Health Study at Harvard\\nSchool of Public Health/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, demonstrated that a diet\\nproviding more than 400 mcg folate and 3 mg vitamin B 6 daily, either from food or supple-\\nments,  might  reduce  a  woman’s  risk  of  heart  attack  by  almost  50  percent.  Although  men\\nwere not included in the study, the results were assumed to apply to them as well.\\n        However,  data  from  a  meta-analysis  published  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical\\nAssociation in December 2006 called this theory into question. Researchers at Tulane Univer-\\nsity examined the results of 12 controlled studies in which 16,958 patients with preexisting\\ncardiovascular disease were given either folic acid supplements or placebos (“look-alike” pills\\nwith no folic acid) for at least six months. The scientists, who found no reduction in the risk\\nof further heart disease or overall death rates among those taking folic acid, concluded that\\nfurther studies will be required to ascertain whether taking folic acid supplements reduces\\nthe risk of cardiovascular disease.\\nAs an antiscorbutic.

Cooking  also\\nchanges the potato’s texture. When you bake a sweet potato, the water inside its cells dis-\\nsolves some of the pectins in its cell walls, so the potato gets softer. As it continues to bake,\\nmoisture begins to evaporate from the cells and the potato shrinks. When you boil sweet\\npotatoes, the initial reaction is just the opposite: at first, the starch granules in the potato\\nabsorb moisture and swell so that the potato looks bigger.

In the study, the men who ate the higher number of potassium-\\nrich foods (an average of nine servings a day) had a risk of stroke 38 percent lower than that of\\nmen who consumed fewer than four servings a day. In 2008, a similar survey at the Queen’s\\nMedical Center (Honolulu) showed a similar protective effect among men and women using\\ndiuretic drugs (medicines that increase urination and thus the loss of potassium).\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n* * *\\n\\nFood/Drug Interactions\\n* * *', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

White  tea  (which  actually  brews  up\\n         slightly pinkish) is made from tea buds and very young leaves which are\\n         steamed  or  “fired”  (heated)  and  then  dried.  Green  teas  are  brewed  from\\n /       slightly more mature leaves, which are allowed to wither before they are\\n         steamed or dried. Oolong teas are made from teas allowed to dry in the\\n         air for a longer time than white or green teas (but for less time than black\\n         teas) before being steamed or fired. Leaves meant for black teas are rolled\\n         and  broken  up  to  allow  full  drying  before  they  are  processed.

Fresh  tea  leaves  are  rich  in  flavonoids  called  cat-\\n echins, but processing the leaves to make black and green teas releases enzymes that enable\\n individual  catechins  to  join  with  others,  forming  new  flavor  and  coloring  agents  called\\n polyphenols (poly means many) that give flavor and color to black and green teas. The length\\n of time tea leaves are left to dry before processing affects the rate at which their catechins\\n are converted to polyphenols. For example, white teas have fewer polyphenols than green\\n teas, which have fewer than oolong, which has fewer than black teas.

The best tea is brewed at the boiling\\npoint of water, a temperature that allows the tea leaves to release flavoring agents quickly\\nwithout overloading the tea with bitter tannins. If the brewing water is below the boiling\\npoint, the leaves will release their flavoring agents so slowly that by the time enough fla-\\nvor molecules have been released into the brew, the ratio of bitter tannins will be so high\\nthat the tea tastes bitter. Brewing tea in water that is too hot also makes a bitter drink. At\\ntemperatures  above  boiling,  the  tannins  are  released  so  fast  that  they  turn  tea  bitter  in  a\\nminute or two.\\n        You cannot judge the flavor of brewed tea by its color. Brewed black teas turn reddish\\nbrown, brewed green teas are almost colorless, and brewed white teas may be pinkish, but\\nthey all have distinctive flavors.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nIced tea.     Hot water can dissolve more pigments from tea leaves than cold water. When tea\\nbrewed in hot water is chilled, as for iced tea, the “extra” pigments will precipitate out and\\nthe tea will look cloudy.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nAs  a  stimulant  and  mood  elevator.          Caffeine  is  a  stimulant.  It  increases  alertness  and  con-\\ncentration, intensifies muscle responses, quickens heartbeat, and elevates mood. Its effects\\nderive  from  the  fact  that  its  molecular  structure  is  similar  to  that  of  adenosine,  a  natural\\nchemical by-product of normal cell activity. Adenosine is a regular chemical that keeps nerve\\ncell activity within safe limits. When caffeine molecules hook up to sites in the brain where\\nadenosine molecules normally dock, nerve cells continue to fire indiscriminately, producing\\nthe  jangly  feeling  sometimes  associated  with  drinking  excess  amounts  of  tea,  coffee,  and\\nother caffeine products.\\n        As a rule, it takes five to six hours to metabolize and excrete caffeine from the body.\\nDuring that time, its effects may vary widely from person to person. Some find its stimu-\\nlation  pleasant,  even  relaxing;  others  experience  restlessness,  nervousness,  hyperactivity,\\ninsomnia, flushing, and upset stomach after as little as one cup a day. It is possible to develop\\na tolerance for caffeine, so people who drink tea every day are likely to find it less immedi-\\nately stimulating than those who drink it only once in a while.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

As a drug, theophylline is\\n    effective in relieving asthmatic spasms, but the relatively low concentrations in brewed tea\\n    are too small to produce therapeutic results.\\n    Lower risk of some kinds of cancer.           In 1991, a number of scientific teams at the Fourth Chemi-\\n   cal Congress of North America announced the identification of chemicals in teas that show\\n   positive  results  in  laboratory  studies  in  which  laboratory  animals  given  green  and  black\\n   tea have lower rates of skin tumors, esophageal tumors, gastrointestinal tract tumors, and\\n   tumors  of  the  lung,  liver  and  pancreas.  Eight  years  later,  in  January  1999,  Purdue  Univer-\\n   sity researchers released a study showing that EGCg, a compound in green tea, inhibits an\\n   enzyme  required  for  cancer  cell  growth,  killing  cancer  cells  in  laboratory  dishes  without\\n   harming healthy cells. The Purdue findings suggest that drinking four cups of green tea a day\\n   may produce a lower overall risk of cancer. NOTE: People who drink tea when it is very hot\\n   (131°F to 153°F) have a higher risk of esophageal cancer than do people who drink tea at a\\n   temperature of 95°F to 117°F. The higher rate of cancer is almost certainly due to the tissues\\n   being injured repeatedly by the extremely hot liquid.\\n   Lower  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease  (heart  attack  and  stroke).               Numerous  studies  have  sug-\\n   gested  that  consuming  moderate  amounts  of  tea  (five  cups  per  day)  reduces  both  overall\\n   mortality (death from all causes) and the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. There are\\n   several possible explanations for this finding. For example, in 2008, a report from INSERM,\\n   France’s  national  institute  for  medical  research,  found  that  women  who  drank  three  or\\n   more cups of tea a day were 11 percent less likely than non–tea drinkers to have cholesterol\\n   plaques (deposits) inside their arteries. In addition, drinking tea appears to increase the abil-\\n   ity of blood vessels to expand, an important factor in protecting against blood clots that may\\n   block the vessel, leading to a heart attack or stroke. In a clinical trial, one group of patients\\n   with coronary artery disease and mildly elevated cholesterol levels were each given four to\\n   six cups of black tea a day for at least four weeks, while a second group got either a bever-\\n   age with the equivalent amount of caffeine or plain hot water. The blood vessels of patients\\n   who drank tea daily dilated more effectively. Some researchers attribute this effect to the\\n   catechins in tea.\\n           Many researchers do not consider these results conclusive either because many studies\\n   showing lower mortality were too small or because tea consumption in the general popula-\\n   tion was too low to allow reliable comparisons between tea drinkers and non–tea drinkers.\\n   As a result, while both black and green teas (and presumably white teas) appear to be protec-\\n   tive, further research is needed to provide firm conclusions about tea and heart health.\\n   Lower  risk  of  some  forms  of  cancer.         Animal studies suggest that both green and black teas\\n   may  reduce  the  risk  of  cancers  of  the  skin,  lung,  mouth,  esophagus,  stomach,  colon,  pan-\\n   creas, bladder, and prostate, while white tea and green tea reduce the incidence of intestinal\\n   polyps. Again, the effects are attributed to the flavonoids (catechins) in the teas. However,\\n   human studies have produced inconsistent results. For example, while some studies show a\\n   decreased risk of colon cancer among tea drinkers, others do not. In general, the assumption\\n   is that further evidence is required before linking tea consumption and cancer prevention.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

By observation, there appears to be a link between tea drink-\\n ing and a lower risk of dental decay. In addition, one study of more than 6,000 14-year old\\n children  in  the  United  Kingdom  found  that  those  who  drank  tea  had  significantly  fewer\\n dental caries than non–tea drinkers, regardless of whether they drank their tea plain or with\\n sugar or milk and sugar. This result may be attributable to the natural presence of fluorides\\n in tea leaves.\\n Methylxanthine (theophylline and caffeine) effects.                 All methylxanthines are central-nervous-\\nsystem stimulants, vasoactive compounds that dilate the skeletal blood vessels and constrict\\nblood vessels in the brain. Theophylline, which effectively relaxes the smooth muscles in the\\nbronchi—the small passages that carry air into the lungs—is used as an asthma medication,\\nbut the relatively low concentrations of theophylline in brewed tea are too small to produce\\ntherapeutic effects.\\n\\n Adverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n Stimulation of the central nervous system.           Taken in excessive amounts, caffeine and theophylline\\n may cause rapid heartbeat, restlessness, sleeplessness, and/or depression in sensitive individu-\\n als. Since different people can tolerate different amounts of caffeine and theophylline without\\n suffering ill effects, exactly which dose produces problems varies from person to person.\\n Constipation.       The tannins in tea may be constipating.\\n Increased  severity  of  premenstrual  syndrome  (PMS).                  Beta-estradiol  and  progesterone,  two\\nhormones that rise and fall during the monthly menstrual cycle, directly affect brain levels\\nof  adenosine  (see  above).  Beta-estradiol  (an  estrogen),  which  rises  just  before  ovulation,\\nkeeps adenosine from slowing down nerve cell activity, which may be why many women\\nfeel  pleasantly  energized  at  mid-cycle.  Progesterone  encourages  adenosine;  it’s  a  soothing\\nhormone. That may be why many women feel tense and irritable when progesterone levels\\nfall just before menstrual bleeding begins. Because caffeine alters adenosine activity in the\\nbrain,  drinking  tea  may  make  beta-estradiol’s  “highs”  higher  and  progesterone’s  “lows”\\nlower. Because tea contains less caffeine than coffee, its effects would be much weaker.\\n\\n Food/Drug Interactions\\n Drugs that make it harder to metabolize caffeine.               Some medical drugs slow the body’s metabo-\\n lism of caffeine, thus increasing its stimulating effect.

The tomatoes should feel heavy for their size;\\ntheir flesh should be firm, not watery. If you plan to use the tomatoes right away, pick ripe\\nones whose skin is a deep orange red. If you plan to store the tomatoes for a few days, pick\\ntomatoes whose skin is still slightly yellow.\\n        Choose  pear-shaped  Italian  plum  tomatoes  for  sauce  making.  They  have  less  water\\nthan ordinary tomatoes and more sugar.\\nAvoid:      Bruised tomatoes or tomatoes with mold around the stem end. The damaged toma-\\ntoes may be rotten inside; the moldy ones may be contaminated with mycotoxins, poisons\\nproduced by molds.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nStore unripe tomatoes at room temperature until they turn fully orange red. Tomatoes picked\\nbefore they have ripened on the vine will be at their most nutritious if you let them continue\\nto ripen at a temperature between 60° and 75°F. Keep them out of direct sunlight, which can\\nsoften the tomato without ripening it and destroy vitamins A and C.

Fully ripe tomatoes should be used within two or three days.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nRemove and discard all leaves and stalks. Wash the tomatoes under cool running water, then\\nslice and serve. Or peel the tomatoes by plunging them into boiling water, then transferring\\nthem on a slotted spoon into a bowl of cold water. The change in temperature damages a\\nlayer of cells just under the skin so that the skin slips off easily.\\n        To get rid of the seeds, cut the tomato in half across the middle and squeeze the halves\\ngently, cut side down, over a bowl. The seeds should pop out easily.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nWhen a tomato is heated the soluble pectins in its cell walls dissolve and the flesh of the tomato\\nturns mushy. But the seeds and peel, which are stiffened with insoluble cellulose and lignin,\\nstay hard. This is useful if you are baking or broiling a tomato (the peel will act as a natural\\n“cup”) but not if you are making a soup or stew. If you add an unpeeled tomato to the dish the\\npeel will split, separate from the tomato flesh, and curl up into hard little balls or strips.\\n        Vitamin C is sensitive to heat. A cooked tomato has less vitamin C than a fresh one,\\nbut it has the same amount of vitamin A because carotenoid pigments are impervious to the\\nheat of normal cooking.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nArtificial ripening.      Tomatoes are available all year round. In the summer, when they can be\\npicked close to the market and have less distance to travel, they are picked vine-ripened. In\\nthe winter, when they have to travel farther, they are picked while the skin is still a bit green\\nso they will not spoil on the way to market. On the vine, in shipping, or in your kitchen,\\ntomatoes  produce  ethylene,  a  natural  ripening  agent  that  triggers  the  change  from  green\\nto red skin. In winter, if the tomatoes are still green when they reach the market, they are\\nsprayed with ethylene—which turns them red. These tomatoes are called hard-ripened (as\\nopposed to vine-ripened). You cannot soften hard-ripened tomatoes by storing them at room\\ntemperature. They should be refrigerated to keep them from rotting.\\nJuice.    Since 2000, following several deaths attributed to unpasteurized apple juice contami-\\nnated with E. coli O157:H7, the FDA has required that all juices sold in the United States be\\npasteurized to inactivate harmful organisms such as bacteria and mold.\\nCanning.       Most canned tomatoes are salted. Unless otherwise labeled, they should be con-\\nsidered  high-sodium  foods.

Tomatoes packed in aseptic boxes may taste fresher than canned toma-\\ntoes because they are cooked for a shorter time before processing.\\nSun-drying.      Sun-dried tomatoes will keep for several months in the refrigerator. If they are\\nnot packed in oil, they have to be “plumped” before you can use them.

Tomatoes  contain  the  red  carotenoid  (pig-\\nment) lycopene, a strong antioxidant that may reduce the risk of some forms of cancer. Cook-\\ning the tomatoes and consuming tomato products with dietary fats such as olive oil makes\\nthe lycopene easier for the body to absorb. In November 2005, the FDA ruled that tomato\\nand  tomato-sauce  products  (including  catsup)  may  carry  labels  with  health  claims  regard-\\ning their ability to reduce the risk of prostate, gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, but\\nthat these claims must be described as “unlikely,” “highly uncertain,” and “highly unlikely.”\\nThere is no evidence that pure lycopene, as in supplements, produces the effects of lycopene\\nin tomato products.\\n       Pale tomatoes, yellow tomatoes, green tomatoes, and tomatoes ripened after picking\\nhave less lycopene than deep-red tomatoes ripened on the vine.\\nLower  risk  of  stroke.      Various  nutrition  studies  have  attested  to  the  power  of  adequate\\npotassium to keep blood pressure within safe levels. For example, in the 1990s, data from\\nthe long-running Harvard School of Public Health/Health Professionals Follow-Up Study\\nof male doctors showed that a diet rich in high-potassium foods such as bananas, oranges,\\nand  plantain  may  reduce  the  risk  of  stroke.  In  the  study,  the  men  who  ate  the  higher\\nnumber of potassium-rich foods (an average of nine servings a day) had a risk of stroke 38\\npercent lower than that of men who consumed fewer than four servings a day. In 2008, a\\nsimilar survey at the Queen’s Medical Center (Honolulu) showed a similar protective effect\\namong men and women using diuretic drugs (medicines that increase urination and thus\\nthe loss of potassium).\\nAs  an  antiscorbutic.      Fresh  tomatoes,  which  are  rich  in  vitamin  C,  help  protect  against\\nscurvy, the vitamin C–deficiency disease.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nOrange skin.

Naturally occurring chemicals (indoles, isothiocyanates, glucosino-\\n    lates, dithiolethiones, and phenols) in cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, and\\n    other cruciferous vegetables appear to reduce the risk of some cancers, perhaps by prevent-\\n    ing the formation of carcinogens in your body or by blocking cancer-causing substances\\n    from reaching or reacting with sensitive body tissues or by inhibiting the transformation\\n    of healthy cells to malignant ones.\\n            All cruciferous vegetables contain sulforaphane, a member of a family of chemicals\\n    known as isothiocyanates.

Cut  out  the  blood  vessels,  rinse  the  heart  thoroughly  (inside  and  out)  under  cold\\n   running water, and prepare as your recipe directs.\\n   Sweetbreads.        Rinse the sweetbreads thoroughly under cold running water and soak in ice\\n   water for at least an hour, changing the water until it remains clear and free of blood. Then\\n   drain the sweetbreads and blanch them in water plus two teaspoons of acid (lemon juice or\\n   vinegar) to firm them. Drain the sweetbreads, cover them with ice water, and remove mem-\\n   branes and connective tissue. Then use as your recipe directs.\\n   Tongue.      Scrub the tongue with a vegetable brush under cold running water.

Don’t forget to wash your hands.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nHeat changes the structure of proteins. It denatures protein molecules—they break apart into\\nsmaller fragments, change shape, or clump together. All these changes force moisture out of\\nprotein tissues. The longer you cook variety meats, the more moisture they will lose. The\\nmeat’s  pigments,  also  denatured  by  the  heat,  combine  with  oxygen  and  turn  brown—the\\nnatural color of cooked meat.\\n        As the meat cooks, its fats oxidize. Oxidized fats, whether formed in cooking or when\\nthe cooked meat is stored in the refrigerator, give cooked meat a characteristic warmed-over\\nflavor the next day. Stewing and storing heart or kidneys under a blanket of antioxidants—\\ncatsup or a gravy made of tomatoes, peppers and other vitamin C–rich vegetables—reduces\\nthe oxidation of fats and the intensity of warmed-over flavor.\\n        All variety meats must be cooked thoroughly.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.     When meat is frozen, the water inside its cells freezes into sharp ice crystals that\\npuncture cell membranes so that water (and B vitamins) leak out of the cells when the meat\\nis  thawed.  Frozen  heart,  kidneys,  and  tripe  are  drier  when  thawed  than  they  would  have\\nbeen fresh. They may also be lower in B vitamins. Freezing may also cause freezer burn, dry\\nspots left when moisture evaporates from the surface of the meat. Waxed freezer paper is\\ndesigned specifically to hold the moisture in frozen meat.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nAs a source of heme iron.        Because the body stores excess iron in the heart, kidneys, and other\\norgans, variety meats are an excellent source of heme iron.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nIncreased risk of cardiovascular disease.            Like other foods from animals, variety meats are a\\nsignificant source of cholesterol and saturated fats, which increase the amount of cholesterol\\ncirculating  in  your  blood  and  raise  your  risk  of  heart  disease.  To  reduce  the  risk  of  heart\\ndisease,  the  National  Cholesterol  Education  Project  recommends  following  the  Step  I  and\\nStep II diets.\\n        The Step I diet provides no more than 30 percent of total daily calories from fat, no\\nmore  than  10  percent  of  total  daily  calories  from  saturated  fat,  and  no  more  than  300  mg\\nof cholesterol per day.

Purines  are  natural  by-products  of  protein  metabolism.  Purines\\n   break down into uric acid, which form sharp crystals that can cause gout if they collect in\\n   your joints or kidney stones if they collect in urine. Sweetbreads and kidneys are a source of\\n   purines. Eating them raises the concentration of purines in your body.

Thick cuts, such as roasts, need long, slow\\n   cooking  to  gelatinize  their  connective  tissue  and  keep  the  veal  from  drying  out.  A  breast\\n   with bones, however, has more fat than a solid roast. Veal scallops and cutlets are the only\\n   kinds of veal that can be sauteed or broiled quickly.\\n\\n   Storing This Food\\n   Refrigerate raw veal immediately, carefully wrapped to prevent its drippings from contami-\\n   nating  the  refrigerator  shelves  or  other  foods.  Refrigeration  prolongs  the  freshness  of  veal\\n   by slowing the natural multiplication of bacteria on the surface of meat. Unchecked, these\\n   bacteria will convert proteins and other substances on the surface of the meat to a slimy film.\\n   Eventually, they will also convert the meat’s sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and\\n   cystine into smelly chemicals called mercaptans that interact with myoglobin to create the\\n   greenish pigment that gives spoiled meat its characteristic unpleasant appearance.\\n           Fresh veal will keep for three to five days in the refrigerator. As a general rule, large\\n   cuts of veal will keep a little longer than small ones. Ground veal, which has many surfaces\\n   where bacteria can live and work, should be used within 48 hours.\\n\\n   Preparing This Food\\n   To lighten the color of veal, marinate the meat in lemon juice or milk overnight in the refrig-\\n   erator. Or marinate it in lemon juice. Trim the meat carefully. By judiciously cutting away all\\n   visible fat you can significantly reduce the amount of fat and cholesterol in each serving.\\n           Do not salt the veal before you cook it.

Since meat has no sugars other than the\\nsmall amounts of glycogen in its muscles, we usually add sugars in the form of marinades\\nor  basting  liquids  that  may  also  contain  acids  (vinegar,  lemon  juice,  wine)  to  break  down\\nmuscle  fibers  and  tenderize  the  meat.  Browning  has  one  minor  nutritional  drawback.  It\\nbreaks  amino  acids  on  the  surface  of  the  meat  into  smaller  compounds  that  are  no  longer\\nuseful proteins.\\n       Heat changes the structure of proteins. It denatures the protein molecules, which means\\nthey break up into smaller fragments or change shape or clump together. All these changes\\nforce water out of protein tissues, which is why meat gets dryer the longer it is cooked. In addi-\\ntion, heat denatures the pigments in meat, which combine with oxygen and turn brown.\\n       As the veal continues to cook, its fats oxidize. Oxidized fats, whether formed in cook-\\ning or when the cooked meat is stored in the refrigerator, give cooked the meat a characteris-\\ntic warmed-over flavor. You can reduce the oxidation of fats and the warmed-over flavor by\\ncooking and storing meat under a blanket of catsup or a gravy made of tomatoes, peppers,\\nand other vitamin C–rich vegetables—all of which are natural antioxidants.\\n       An obvious nutritional benefit of cooking is that it liquifies the fat in the meat so that it can\\nrun off. And, of course, cooking makes veal safer by killing Salmonella and other organisms.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\nFreezing.     When you thaw frozen veal it may be less tender than fresh veal. It may also be\\nlower in B vitamins. While the veal is frozen, the water inside its cells turn into sharp ice\\ncrystals that can puncture cell membranes. When the veal thaws, moisture (and some of the\\nB vitamins) will leak out through these torn cell walls. The loss of moisture is irreversible.\\n       Freezing  can  also  cause  freezer  burn,  the  dry  spots  where  moisture  has  evaporated\\nfrom the surface of the meat. Waxed freezer paper is designed specifically to hold the mois-\\nture in meat.\\n       Freezing slows the oxidation of fats and the multiplication of bacteria so that the veal\\nstays usable longer than it would in a refrigerator. At 0°F fresh veal will keep for four to eight\\nmonths. (Beef, which has fewer oxygen-sensitive unsaturated fatty acids than veal, will keep\\nfor up to a year.)\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\n* * *\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nIncreased  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease.

Margarines  may  also  contain\\ncoloring agents (to make the margarine look like butter), emulsifiers, and milk or animal fats\\n(including butter).\\n        Margarine should be refrigerated, closely wrapped to keep it from picking up odors from\\nother foods.

If you add salt\\nto the water before it starts to boil, the water molecules will need to pick up extra energy in\\norder to overcome the greater attractive forces between the salt and water molecules. Since\\nthe energy comes from heat, adding salt raises the boiling point of the water. Salted water\\nboils at a higher temperature than plain water does.

Water  is  the  only  compound  that  expands  when  it  freezes.  A  water  molecule  is\\nshaped roughly like an open triangle, with an oxygen atom at the center and a hydrogen atom\\nat  the  end  of  either  arm.  When  water  is  frozen,  its  molecules  move  more  slowly,  and  each\\nhydrogen atom forms a temporary bond to the oxygen atom on a nearby water molecule. The\\nphenomenon, known as hydrogen bonding, creates a rigid structure in which the molecules\\nstretch out rather than pack closely together, as normally happens when a substance is cooled.\\nAn ounce of frozen water (ice) takes up more room than an ounce of liquid water.\\n“Softening.”      Home  water  softeners  that  filter  out  “hard”  calcium  carbonate  and  replace  it\\nwith sodium may increase the sodium content of tap water by as much as 100 mg per quart.\\n\\nMedical Uses and/or Benefits\\nMaintaining  body  functions.           The body uses water in and around body cells and tissues to\\nregulate body temperature; create blood, lymph, and body secretions; digest food; dissolve\\nand circulate nutrients; eliminate waste; and lubricate joints.\\nProtection against dental cavities.           Fluoridated drinking water provides fluoride ions that are\\nincorporated into the crystalline structure of dental enamel, hardening the tooth surface and\\nmaking it more resistant to bacteria such as Mutans streptococcus, a type of bacteria that live\\nin sticky dental plaque, digesting sugars and excreting acidic material that eats away at the\\ntooth.

Heatstroke  is  a  medical  emergency  caused  by  dehydra-\\n tion  resulting  from  the  failure  to  replace  fluids  lost  through  excess  perspiration.  Drinking\\n adequate amounts of water while exercising or working in a hot environment reduces (but\\n does not entirely eliminate) the risk of heatstroke. NOTE: Alcoholic beverages and caffein-\\n ated beverages are mild diuretics; drinking them increases your loss of water.\\n Antacid, diuretic, and laxative effects.           Mineral waters are natural mild diuretics and, because\\n they contain sodium bicarbonate, naturally antacid. Any kind of water, taken warm about\\n a  half  hour  before  breakfast,  appears  to  be  mildly  laxative,  perhaps  because  it  stimulates\\n contractions of the muscles in the digestive tract.\\n\\n Adverse Effects Associated with This Food\\n Contaminants.         Drinking water may pick up a variety of chemical contaminants as it trav-\\n els through the ground or through pipes. To date, more than 300  chemical contaminants,\\n including arsenic, asbestos, nitrates and nitrites, pesticides, and lead, have been identified in\\n the  water  systems  of  various  American  cities.  Even  chlorine,  which  is  added  to  the  water\\n supply  to  eliminate  potentially  hazardous  microorganisms,  can  be  a  problem.  The  free\\n chlorine generated during the purification process may react with organic compounds in the\\n water to produce trihalomethanes, such a chloroform, which are suspected carcinogens or\\n mutagens (substances that alter the structure of DNA). To prevent this, the Environmental\\n Protection Agency (EPA) monitors chlorinated water supplies to make sure that the level of\\n trihalomethanes remains below 0.10 mg/liter (100 parts per billion), a level currently consid-\\n ered safe for human consumption.\\n Water  overload.       On  an  average  day,  a  healthy  adult  may  lose  2,500  ml  (milliliters)  water\\nthrough breathing, perspiring, urinating, and defecating. An ounce is equal to 30 ml, so we\\ncan replace the fluid we lose with eight 10-ounce glasses of water or any equivalent combina-\\ntion of water plus other liquids and/or foods with a high water content. However, in 2008,\\nan  editorial  in  The  Journal  of  the  American  Society  of  Nephrology,  the  professional  publication\\nof the association of doctors specializing in kidney diseases, questioned the validity of the\\n“eight-glass-a-day” rule. They concluded that there is no clear evidence to support drinking\\nlarge quantities of water and that it is more sensible for healthy people to drink when thirsty\\nrather than to rely on a specific amount of water each day. Their reasoning was simple: If we\\ntake in much more water than we need to replace what we lose, the excess water will dilute\\nthe liquid inside our cells, lowering the normal concentration of electrolytes (sodium, potas-\\nsium, chloride). Because a proper ratio of electrolytes is vital to the transmission of impulses\\nfrom cell to cell, a continued excessive intake of fluid may cause water intoxication, a condi-\\ntion  whose  symptoms  include  lethargy,  muscle  spasms,  convulsions,  coma,  and/or  death.\\nHealthy people whose kidneys are able to eliminate a temporary water overload are unlikely\\nto suffer from water intoxication, but diets that require excessive water consumption may be\\nhazardous for epileptics and others at risk of seizures.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Plain cereals are digested very slowly,\\n producing only a gradual rise in the level of sugar in the blood. As a result, the body needs\\n less insulin to control blood sugar after eating unsugared cereals made from additive-free\\n grain  than  after  eating  some  other  high-carbohydrate  foods  (such  as  bread  or  potato).  In\\n studies at the University of Kentucky, a whole-grain-, bean-, vegetable-, and fruit-rich diet\\n developed at the University of Toronto and recommended by the American Diabetic Asso-\\n ciation enabled patients with type 1 diabetes (who do not produce any insulin themselves)\\n to cut their daily insulin intake by 38 percent. For patients with type 2 diabetes (who can\\n produce  some  insulin)  the  bean  diet  reduced  the  need  for  injected  insulin  by  98  percent.\\n This diet is in line with the nutritional guidelines of the American Diabetes Association,\\n although  people  with  diabetes  should  always  consult  with  their  doctor  and/or  dietitian\\n before altering their diets.\\n Lower  risk  of  heart  disease.        In  2007,  researchers  from  the  Harvard  Medical  School  and\\nBrigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, released an analysis of data from the long-run-\\nning 21,400-man Physicians Health Follow-Up Study showing that men who consume seven\\nor more servings of whole-grain cereal a week are 21 percent less likely to suffer from heart\\nfailure than are men who do not consume whole grain cereals daily. The results held true\\nregardless of how much the men weighed, whether they smoked or drank or took vitamin\\npills,  or  had  a  history  of  high  blood  pressure  and  high  cholesterol.

Red wines improve (“mature”) in the bottle; their\\ntaste is deeper and mellower after a year or two, and some continue to age for as long as 15\\nyears. Keep the bottle on its side so that the wine flows down and keeps the cork wet. A\\nwet cork expands to seal the bottle even more tightly and keep extra air from coming into\\nthe bottle and oxidizing the wine to vinegar. (Bottles with plastic corks or screw tops can be\\nstored upright. Their seals are air-tight.)\\n        Store leftover wine in a small bottle with a tight cap and as little air space as possible.\\nUse leftover table wines as soon as possible (or let them oxidize to vinegar). Appetizer and\\ndessert wines, which are higher in alcohol content than table wines, may taste good for as\\nlong as a month after the bottle is opened.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nAll  wines  contain  volatile  molecules  that  give  the  beverage  its  characteristic  flavor  and\\naroma.  Warming  the  liquid  excites  these  molecules  and  intensifies  the  flavor  and  aroma.\\nWhile dry white or rosé wines are usually chilled before serving, sweet white wines and the\\nmore flavorful reds are best served at room temperature.\\n        Stand a bottle of wine upright for a day before serving it, so that the sediment (dregs)\\nwill settle to the bottom. When you open a bottle of wine, handle it gently to avoid stirring\\nup the sediment.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nWhen you heat wine, its alcohol evaporates but its flavor remains. Since evaporation concen-\\ntrates the flavor, be sure the wine you’re using tastes good enough to drink; cooking won’t\\nimprove the flavor of a bad wine.\\n        In cooking, when you add the wine depends on what you want it to do. As a tender-\\nizer, add the wine when you start cooking; for flavor, near the end of the cooking process.\\n        Alcohol is an acid. If you cook it in an aluminum or iron pot, it will react with metal\\nions to form dark compounds that discolor the pot and the food. Recipes made with wine\\nshould be prepared in an enameled, glass, or stainless steel pot.\\n\\nHow Other Kinds of Processing Affect This Food\\n* * *', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In  January  1999,  the  results  of  a  677-person  study  published  by\\nresearchers  at  New  York  Presbyterian  Hospital–Columbia  University  showed  that  moder-\\nate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of stroke due to a blood clot in the brain among\\nolder  people  (average  age:  70).  How  the  alcohol  prevents  stroke  is  still  unknown,  but  it  is\\nclear that moderate use of alcohol is a key. Heavy drinkers (those who consume more than\\nseven drinks a day) have a higher risk of stroke. People who once drank heavily, but cut their\\nconsumption to moderate levels, may also reduce their risk of stroke. Numerous later studies\\nhave confirmed these findings.\\nReduced risk of heart attack.           Data from the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention\\nStudy 1, an 12-year survey of more than 1 million Americans in 25 states, shows that men\\nwho take one drink a day have a 21 percent lower risk of heart attack and a 22 percent lower\\nrisk of stroke than men who do not drink at all. Women who have up to one drink a day also\\nreduce their risk of heart attack. Numerous later studies have confirmed these findings.\\nLower  cholesterol  levels.       Beverage  alcohol  decreases  the  body’s  production  and  storage  of\\nlow density lipoproteins (LDLs), the protein and fat particles that carry cholesterol into your\\narteries. As a result, people who drink moderately tend to have lower cholesterol levels and\\nhigher  levels  of  high  density  lipoproteins  (HDLs),  the  fat  and  protein  particles  that  carry\\ncholesterol out of the body.\\nAppetite stimulation.        Alcohol beverages stimulate the production of saliva and gastric acids\\nthat cause the stomach contractions we call hunger pangs. Moderate amounts, which may\\nhelp stimulate appetite, are often prescribed for geriatric patients, convalescents, and people\\nwho do not have ulcers or other chronic gastric problems.\\nDilation of blood vessels.        Alcohol dilates the tiny blood vessels just under the skin, bringing\\nblood up to the surface. That’s why moderate amounts of alcohol beverages (0.2–1 gram per\\nkilogram  of  body  weight—that  is,  6.6  ounces  of  wine  for  a  150-pound  adult)  temporarily\\nwarms the drinker. But the warm blood that flows up to the surface of the skin will cool\\ndown there, making you even colder when it circulates back into the center of your body.\\nThen an alcohol flush will make you perspire, so that you lose more heat. Excessive amounts\\nof beverage alcohol may depress the mechanism that regulates body temperature.\\n\\nAdverse Effects Associated with This Food\\nIncreased risk of breast cancer.

Alcohol  is  absorbed  from  the  stomach  and  small  intestine  and  carried  by  the\\nbloodstream  to  the  liver,  where  it  is  oxidized  to  acetaldehyde  by  alcohol  dehydrogenase\\n(ADH), the enzyme our bodies use every day to metabolize the alcohol we produce when\\nwe  digest  carbohydrates.  The  acetaldehyde  is  converted  to  acetyl  coenzyme  A  and  either\\neliminated from the body or used in the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and body tis-\\nsues. Although individuals vary widely in their capacity to metabolize alcohol, an adult of\\naverage  size  can  metabolize  the  alcohol  in  13  ounces  (400  ml)  of  wine  in  approximately\\nfive to six hours. If he or she drinks more than that, the amount of alcohol in the body will\\nexceed the available supply of ADH. The surplus, unmetabolized alcohol will pile up in the\\nbloodstream,  interfering  with  the  liver’s  metabolic  functions.  Since  alcohol  decreases  the\\nreabsorption of water from the kidneys and may inhibit the secretion of an antidiuretic hor-\\nmone, the drinker will begin to urinate copiously, losing magnesium, calcium, and zinc but\\nretaining more irritating uric acid. The level of lactic acid in the body will increase, making\\nhim or her feel tired and out of sorts; the acid-base balance will be out of kilter; the blood\\nvessels of the head will swell and throb and the stomach, its lining irritated by the alcohol,\\nwill ache. The ultimate result is a “hangover” whose symptoms will disappear only when\\nenough time has passed to allow the body to marshal the ADH needed to metabolize the\\nextra alcohol in the blood.\\nChanges  in  body  temperature.            Alcohol  dilates  capillaries,  tiny  blood  vessels  just  under  the\\nskin, producing a “flush” that temporarily warms the drinker. But drinking is not an effec-\\ntive way to stay warm in cold weather. Warm blood flowing up from the body core to the\\nsurface  capillaries  is  quickly  chilled,  making  you  even  colder  when  it  circulates  back  into\\nyour  organs.  In  addition,  an  alcohol  flush  triggers  perspiration,  further  cooling  your  skin.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Taken concurrently with alcohol, the anti-\\n   alcoholism drug disulfiram can cause flushing, nausea, a drop in blood pressure, breathing\\n   difficulty, and confusion. The severity of the symptoms, which may vary among individu-\\n   als, generally depends on the amount of alcohol consumed and the amount of disulfiram in\\n   the body.\\n   Anticoagulants (blood thinners).           Alcohol slows the body’s metabolism of anticoagulants such\\n   as warfarin (Coumadin), intensifying the effect of the drugs and increasing the risk of side\\n   effects such as spontaneous nosebleeds.\\n   Antidepressants.        Alcohol may increase the sedative or other central nervous system effects\\n   of  any  antidepressant.  Combining  alcohol  with  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)  inhibitors\\n   is  especially  hazardous.  MAO  inhibitors  inactivate  naturally  occurring  enzymes  in  your\\n   body that metabolize tyramine, a substance found in many fermented or aged foods that\\n   constricts blood vessels and increases blood pressure. If you eat a food containing tyramine\\n   while  you  are  taking  an  MAO  inhibitor,  you  cannot  effectively  eliminate  the  tyramine\\n   from your body. The result may be a hypertensive crisis. Ordinarily, fermentation of beer\\n   and  ale  does  not  produce  tyramine,  but  some  patients  have  reported  tyramine  reactions\\n   after drinking some imported beers.

Acorn  squash  should  have\\na  wide-ribbed,  dark  green  shell.  The  longer  the  squash  is  stored,  the  more  orange  it  will\\nbecome as its green chlorophyll pigments fade and the yellow carotenes underneath show\\nthrough. Butternut squash should be a smooth, creamy brown or yellow. Hubbard squash has a\\nridged and bumpy orange red shell flecked with dark blue or gray. Spaghetti squash is smooth\\nand yellow. If the squash is sliced, the flesh inside should be smooth and evenly colored.\\n\\nStoring This Food\\nStore  winter  squash  in  a  cool,  dry  cabinet  to  protect  its  vitamins  A  and  C.  Squash  stores\\nwell. Hubbards, for example, may stay fresh for up to six months, acorn squash for three to\\nsix months.\\n        Do not refrigerate winter squash. Winter squash stored at cold temperatures convert\\ntheir starches to sugars.\\n\\nPreparing This Food\\nWash the squash and bake it whole, or cut it in half or in quarters (or smaller portions if it\\nis very large), remove the stringy part and the seeds, and bake or boil. Baking is the more\\nnutritious method since it preserves the most nutrients.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Cook This Food\\nWhen you bake a squash, the soluble food fibers in its cell walls dissolve and the squash\\ngets softer.

As many as two of every 1,000 babies born in the United\\nStates  each  year  may  have  cleft  palate  or  a  neural  tube  (spinal  cord)  defect  due  to  their\\nmothers’  not  having  gotten  adequate  amounts  of  folate  during  pregnancy.  The  current\\nRDA for folate is 180 mcg for a woman and 200 mcg for a man, but the FDA now recom-\\nmends 400 mcg for a woman who is or may become pregnant. Taking folate supplements\\nbefore  becoming  pregnant  and  continuing  through  the  first  two  months  of  pregnancy\\nreduces the risk of cleft palate; taking folate through the entire pregnancy reduces the risk\\nof neural tube defects.\\nPossible  lower  risk  of  heart  attack.

            "\n",
            "### Ingredients:\n",
            "- **Dough**: 1½ cups warm water (105°F-115°F), 1 package active dry yeast, 3¾ cups bread flour, 2 tbsp olive oil, 2 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp sugar.\n",
            "- **Sauce**: Tomato sauce or white sauce.\n",
            "- **Toppings**: Cheese (mozzarella, fontina, etc.), vegetables (sautéed or raw), meats (pepperoni, sausage, etc.), and any other favorite toppings.\n",

            "### Instructions:\n",
            "1. **Prepare the Dough**:\n",
            "   - Dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes.\n",
            "   - In a mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar. Then, add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.\n",

            "   - Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.\n",
            "   - Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel (or an inverted baking sheet) sprinkled with cornmeal to prevent sticking.\n",
            "   - Top the dough with sauce, followed by your choice of cheese and toppings.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Bake the Pizza**:\n",
            "   - Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.\n",
            "   - Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Serve**:\n",
